            "I am trying to get something to convert screenshots of poker hand range matrices into a specific text format.\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/UjgNnIC](https://imgur.com/a/UjgNnIC)\n\nHere is an example of a screenshot. Each square represents the frequencies in which a player would raise (red) or call (black). Its tedious inputting the ranges into another program that takes in mouse clicks with a scroll wheel to change the frequency or you can enter the text. Like so:\n\n [https://imgur.com/a/2cyESQb](https://imgur.com/a/2cyESQb)\n\nAA-JJ,AKs,KQs,QJs,AKo,\\[90.0\\]AQs-AJs\\[/90.0\\],\\[75.0\\]TT-88\\[/75.0\\],\\[50.0\\]AQo,KQo\\[/50.0\\]\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo as you can see there are multiple problems I am having.\n\n1. Accurately reading the percentages of each square. The screenshots are about 600x600 and not every pixel is crisp so its difficult to code logic to say which pixel is red, black or grey.\n2. There needs to be some cleaning since ALL hands that are a specific frequency percentage need to be grouped together in between \\[xx.0\\] <hands, hands,>\\[/xx.0\\]. So I can't just go through a for loop with the associated hands and link the frequencies with the hand, I need another pass to get it organized into the specified format.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf anyone could help with discerning between rgb values of a low quality screenshot I'd be very grateful. Right now I'm taking the length of the image, dividing it by 13, taking the floor of that then looping through one square to take the ratio between rgb values in the pixel before it and if its close to 1 += a color count if not divide it by the length/13 (handsquarewidth) and adding it to a frequency dictionary. \n\nThe intermediary area sometimes is 3 or 4 pixels wide so it cuts down on the total frequency so i end up with for the AJs square  \\[0.425, 0.0, 0.525\\]. 42.5% raise, 0.0% due to the gradient area, and 52.5% call. Which doesn't look right because im doing 40 pixels for the hand square width which may not begin at the very start of the square and the gradient area cuts out some percents. It looks more like 35/65 to me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAny advice is welcomed.",

This week I hope to finish up the dynamic unloading/reloading of users automation code and have a working MQTT handler (although not a complete one, but enough for simple events).  The hard part with the reloading of user code is that I have to carefully track all callbacks registered (and which module they came from) and unregister them or the user's old code will still be called when events happen.\n\nThis is a rather big project, I plan to post it to github once their is more functionality; however, if this project interests others and they want to help work on it let me know.",

I know that I've seen people that come from other languages reach for `map` pretty often.",
            "Map() is one of my favorite functions in python tbh",
            "I use `map` or `itertools.starmap` and `filter` when I already have the exact function I needed. This is a lot easier to read:\n\n    map(isoparse, birthdays)\n    filter(str.isalpha, names)\n\ncompared to:\n\n    [isoparse(bd) for bd in birthdays]\n    [nm for nm in names if nm.isalpha()]\n\nUsing `map` means I don't have to invent a meaningless loop variable like `bd` and `nm` that has to be repeated twice or thrice when using list comprehension. For most other cases I use list comprehension.\n\nIf you're defining functions/lambda just so you can use map, I think that is an anti pattern. You should just use list comprehension for those cases."

            "Conda is a sort of superset of PIP.  It handles dependencies outside of Python, which are necessary for some ML libraries, and manages the virtualenv.  Anaconda is a distribution of many commonly used packages which is easier to setup for those who aren\u2019t as technically inclined. I\u2019d recommend using conda for packaging any sort of ML related project.",
            "Installing scientific packages on Python used to be a pain, especially on non-Linux systems. Ananconda made it a lot easier. These days it's not really an issue.",
            "If you're doing web development or something, pip is fine.   If you're doing complex machine learning, the fact that Anaconda handles all dependency management and ensures compatibility among all the hundreds of packages in its distribution is a godsend.  Could you spend hours pip installing all that stuff yourself?   Sure.    But why?",
            "To add to what others have said, building numpy with MKL bindings on your own is an exercise in frustration. Conda just ships them together.\n\nI've also had much better experience running CI for compiled components on different operating systems through Conda instead of standard CPython.",
            "I remember having a horrible time installing the usual data analysis packages under Windows, until finding out it Just Worked with Anaconda.",
            "For a lot of people a dependable version and distribution matter. Some of us work on remote machines with managed software stacks that have no internet access. Anaconda gives you a whole distribution so you already know what is there from python version to package versions. This is good for users because you don't need to get a bunch of different versions of stuff manually. You can just use the anaconda distribution.",
            "Python 2 and the rapid development of python 3 is a significant factor driving anaconda usage.\n\nIf you can't trust the system python to be up to date enough to be able to install the other libraries you need from pip, then you are forced to build python from source.\n\nHaving to build python from source was the leading cause of suicides, and the national suicide prevention hotline created anaconda as a response.",
            "Other people all have good points. One that I want to add -- Conda is actually a package manager not only for Python, but also for C/C++, R, Ruby, Lua, ect.  Unlike pip, a lot of the packages installed in Conda are straight up binaries rather than python files. So heavy loading processes such as ML and data processing might run faster in Conda packages compared to Python packages.",
            "Some years ago, conda was the solution to the dependency problems people started to have in the science community. Say you have an old big python program that is not well maintained but used by some people, and that breaks with newer libraries. How do you run this thing without breaking the other newer scripts on the server?\n\nOr some data scientist shares a Jupiter notebook on the web that doesn\u2019t work for you because of some incompatible library. Easy to solve if they share the conda environment file, too.",
            "I don't use Conda much at all, but when I do, I am generally impressed. If you need a solid tool to manage both dependencies and Python versions, it is a good option. Especially if you are into data science. Especially if all the packages you need are in [the conda repository](https://anaconda.org/anaconda/repo).\n\nI haven't felt the need for the whole Anaconda distribution. Just Conda seems worth a try.\n\n_Plenty_ of other options for virtual environment, project and dependency management. [I wrote a rundown recently](https://dev.to/bowmanjd/python-tools-for-managing-virtual-environments-3bko), and I am sure I didn't cover them all. Summary, if you don't feel like reading: use [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/), [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/), or Conda, depending on your interests and needs. Also, [Pyflow](https://github.com/David-OConnor/pyflow) is rather interesting.",
            "Because pip has a very poor dependency resolver, and because pip does not have the notion of dependency against compiled libraries outside the python ecosystem, something you care a lot to ensure you can deploy complex libraries without having them crash because you don't have libpng/mkl/vtk/whatnot",
            "The only reason i use anaconda is because when i tried to install python itself for some reason it did not work so i installed anaconda.",
            "I use pip. Pip is hope",
            "If you're on Linux, I wouldn't bother. Anaconda provides some benefit to Windows users, but it's a real pain to get it working. Our CI builds regularly fail due to conda issues, which is really annoying. It can be very slow to build and resolve a new environment, but some of the blame could be due to Windows (file locks, etc.).\n\nUsing conda on Linux though is just a world of pain for not much benefit. Stick with pip."

            "Have you thought about changing jobs?  There's a lot of SV tech companies hiring remote right now.",
            "Its the same with most companies and most languages.",
            "During your next job interview(and it sounds like there should be one soon) remember that while they are interviewing you, you should also be interviewing them. Ask to see an example of their \"best\" code AND an example of their \"worst\" code. If they refuse keep looking! If they say they have no bad code - they're lying. If they say yes ask to sit with one of their developers and walk thru a couple programs - ask the developer lots of questions -- by the end of an hour you'll know everything you need to know about the work environment and their values. This has saved me from hiring onto a death march more than once.",
            "I wouldn't call it \"Python fatigue\", it's more like a disease in the whole industry (not just software engineering, I'd say it affects every tech company). At home I have the newest hardware (well, not the newest, but usually not older than 2-5 years), most recent software (Archlinux, Fedora, yay), and can use whatever library I want, whatever coding style I want. I can write unit tests, I can run Gitlab instances with CI/CD, and so on.\n\nBut at work \u2026 I mean we still have machines running MS-DOS. We're using 2GB IDE disks and norton commander for making backups on those machines.\n\nA lot of people also don't understand that you can't write an app once and it will run forever. Software engineering, like mechanical and electrical engineering, requires maintenance. There are companies that understand that, and there are companies that don't. Try to find one that understands it.\n\nMy tl;dr is that many companies are currently in the process of changing and accepting that software engineering is not a one time thing. And if you want to improve code quality you absolutely need unit tests, and you need someone who maintains the code. And also, that they need to risk breaking a few things because the tests weren't good enough. Trying to deliver better software is \u2013 in my books \u2013 still better than not touching old code because we could break something.\n\nSo \u2026 yeah. I'm not sure if that helps you, just my point of view.",
            "My experience is that you'll see much the same thing in large enterprise codebases, to a greater or lesser extent, irrespective of which language you're working in. Certainly, the worst things I've seen in Java codebases are worse than the worst things I've seen in Python codebases.\n\nIt's also my experience that large enterprise-y open source projects are about as bad as large enterprise-y internal projects. For example, I've previously attempted to fix issues with Cobbler and Ansible, and (at the risk of causing controversy), found that both are at least as messed up as the internal project I was working on that used them. There's a certain amount of \"this project is my CV\" than motivates maintainers to keep smaller projects sane, but once a project becomes a product, it's subject to the same pointy-haired-boss nonsense as internal projects.\n\nSome languages have a bit less of this, mostly by virtue of being \"a bit weird\" (I'm thinking things like Erlang or Clojure), so only relatively confident developers would use them. But as soon as you've got a project that uses these languages in an organisation with bad hiring practices, you end up with a worse mess than you'd get if you'd used something boring like Java, as developers who don't know the language try and write code in it anyway - Ruby kinda went this way, when it want from being \"a hidden gem\", to \"hip\", to \"something people who look at Gartner quadrants want to try\", to \"the new PHP\".\n\nAll that said, if the problem is (say) that you've got a bunch of mediocre C# developers who are forced to write Python, and are insisting on writing C#-ish Python, maybe the answer is to just use C#. It's the path of least resistance, and I mention C# as it's a language that works well for mixed-ability teams.",
            "What are they doing to abuse isinstance()?",
            "All problems you mentioned are not really related Python. Everything would happen with a different programming language, just details changed. Some languages might be slightly more or less prone to particular types of abuse, but in every one it is possible to write horrible code.\n\nWhat you describe seems to caused by inadequate technical leadership at your company. A good technical leader should protect and promote efforts to improve code quality and to adopt best practices. The leader should allocate time for internal work that can be improve productivity in longer term, like refactorings or training. \n\nIf you can't improve your leaders (e.g. by being promoted to be one), then it is time find a better company.",
            "Find a team that will last longer than 5 years. Adding bad code means you\u2019re going to end up with a loooottttt of technical debt.\n\nLower productivity? You don\u2019t have time to NOT fix code.",
            "Down to project management I'm afraid, a lot of that stuff.  I remember the first largish programming project I worked on ( not python).  Numerous teams, including an architecture team.  Kick off meeting for all the devs, the PM introduces the architecture team, and tells everyone that anyone who doesn't plan on following standards should leave now, and that during the project anyone who won't follow standards, or gives the arch or qa teams any grief about it, is going to be summarily walked.  Worked pretty well.\n\nNothing to do with language;all to do with culture and leadership.",
            "Others may not like my answer, but feel free to change tech stack too! 5 years is a lot, maybe you\u2019d feel a bit more refreshed working with other languages. I know that maintaining enterprise Python apps can be easily a nightmare, especially pre-3.6 type hints.",
            "The company is doomed. Leave.",
            "I've been in the same boat and one day I've just decided to refactor my code to have as many bad practice as I could fit in. I hoped that someone would tell me to stop and revert the changes (we had no code review) but nope. No one cared about that. That was the day when I realised that I need to find a new job. Thankfully I've found a job where my teammates share my opinion on how to write maintainable and clean code. I count myself VERY lucky. I still see a ton of bad code made by other teams in the company but at least I'm not turned down whenever I try to improve quality.",
            "Sounds like you have a bad team or company.",
            "Sounds like we work at the same company. Unfortunately, this seems to be a wide spread issue throughout the industry. You can either find another job where these code standards are valued, or you can try to push them harder on you current team. Maybe have a discussion with management? Unfortunately it seems quickly delivered \"working\" code will always be valued over more meticulous and slightly more time consuming code that is actually readable and standardized.",
            "A few of these things I can sympathize with your team on. I hate running flake8 and being told 400 times that my lines are 10 characters too long - that's not a problem with me, that's a problem with flake8. buried in the noise are a lot of \"variables defined and not used\" which is where all the real bugs are. if 5 times out of 10 it flagged what was basically a bug i'd feel better about it.\n\nI also look at some of these and see problems but not necessarily *big* problems - I don't like import * either but in every code base I've worked on where we've had it it's been the least of our problems so I wouldn't necessarily push it too hard (e.g. wouldnt' necessarily reject an otherwise decent pull request, although i'd comment). I never have it in my open source, but I kind of have to tolerate it and other things like it in commercial code otherwise a lot of production code would just never get deployed.\n\nI don't think you can apply the same rules in open source to commercial code. You're under different pressures and different constraints.\n\nThis isn't to say that code quality doesn't matter but I tend to find that you have to deal with it by identifying 10 problems and figuring out which is the biggest one for *all* of you and fix that rather than having a checklist of guidelines which you can mandate everybody follows or \"code doesn't get merged\". quality gates don't work when people aren't bought into them.\n\nIf they're rejecting the idea of making small changes where it's easy to understand the benefit, that's potentially a different story. i suspect they may be unconvinced of the benefit of many of these things though (& it will take some 'splainin to get them to see the light).",

I think it's just easy to get burnt out dealing with the same problems every day. That happens in most jobs though. Maybe a slight job change would help? Other things to do than just software development? The sad truth behind a lot of these problems is if you don't establish good behaviors as a baseline you can never get people to change. If you don't have linting and CI and reviews in place from the beginning you will never in a million years convince someone it's a good use of time.",

At another job they had some super over complicated code in ASP.NET and nobody was allowed to touch it except for some outside consultant who they paid who knows what to maintain it.\n\nI have worked at companies when I was a consultant that did not even have source control. We used a shared network drive. Another there was no build machine because the build was a specific developers laptop. One day that laptop died. No builds for what i believe was almost two months.

            "It's better for everyone to move on, and whomever made the choice for the library would be either dragging people screaming and kicking into the new version, or leave a lot of outdated, and vulnerable code out there.\n\nBreak the code in same way to force people onto the new version or they'll be stupid and go with the last stable version and pray.\n\nI don't envy your position, but good luck.",
            "Not enough info to really answer the question.\n\nDo you use features of newer python versions? Does the developer team have the bandwidth to handle whatever work is involved in supporting older versions? \n\nIt comes down to balancing available resources vs resource cost to continue support.\n\nI can easily imagine two different libraries where the answer to the question about supporting older python versions is different because different projects have different amounts of available resources and different amounts of required resources to support older python versions.",
            "HEll YEAH it is.",
            "There isn't a single concept of \"dropping support\", there are many different ways you can execute a sunset policy:\n\n1. You can hard-drop support and start deliberately using new features everywhere and drop all compatibility shims so that won't work in older versions, reject any patches that restores support for older versions.\n\n2. You can drop explicit support for older versions, but keep a \"best-effort\" policy to merge patches that restore support if people made a PR that backports the library to older syntaxes\n\n3. You can drop explicit support for older versions, but don't actually try to actively break older versions, they just don't get tested and it'll only break when someday someone will submit a patch that breaks the older version.\n\n4. You can make a separate maintenance fork for the older versions, they won't get all the new features but if people make PRs on those branch to backport fixes or other features, they're welcome to do so and they will get merged like any others\n\nThere are infinitely many in the spectrum of sunset policy, but ultimately it's the maintainer's decision on what they are willing to spend time supporting on. If the maintainer works in company that uses the library for a mission critical software that still uses Python 2.7, they'd be unlikely to accept dropping support for it as long as that mission critical software is still running on the old version.\n\nIn any case, consider that people who don't upgrade their Python version probably are also fine not getting the latest updates from your library. If they're interested in bleeding edge, they'd have upgraded to Python 3 as well a long time ago.\n\nIf you're not the core maintainer of a project, you won't be making these decisions for them. They're the one that decides what they want to support. If they tell you your PR need to run on 2.7, you make sure they do if you're interested in getting it merged to the project. \n\nIf you're not happy with that situation, you can maintain your own fork, modernize the codebase in your own fork, and publish your own package; pretty much all FLOSS license allows you to do so. If you get enough people interested enough in the changes you're making, the crowd might start shifting to your fork and the two projects can live happily apart. Forked projects that becomes more popular than the original projects are relatively rare, but it happens from time to time.",

            "While learning/studying it's normal for something to not be intuitive. If everything is directly clear to you then is the study really worth the time? The study is supposed to learn you something, and if you're struggling to understand something but eventually do, it's learning you something.\n\nAlso, what is it that is causing you trouble with loops, maybe I(we on reddit) can help you if we know that?",
            "    my_items = [1, 2, 3]\n    for x in my_items:\n        print(x)\n\nLet's use a simple example. When a loop runs, you are \"iterating\" through each item in the list. The item is assigned to the variable x in the above example. The indented code is then executed. Once we get to the end of the block, the flow goes back to the \"for\" statement. The second value in the list is assigned to x and we execute the indented block of code. This repeats until we run out of items in the list. The flow then continues on with whatever code comes after. \n\nYou could manually write out the above loop, which would be\n\n    x = 1\n    print(x)\n    x = 2\n    print(x)\n    x = 3\n    print(x)\n\nBoth of these code examples will produce the same output. However, the second requires very explicit commands. What if you want a longer set of values, or different values? With the for loop, you can simply provide a new value for my_items and the loop will print each value in the list.",
            "What exactly are you having trouble with?",
            "The best thing that ever helped me out with loops was sounding my loops out in my head as sentences. Python is really great to start that with because it is a coding language that is very close to the English language and how we structure words and sentences. (At least that's how I feel). However, I have taken this approach even in other languages I have learned.\n\nAn example:\n\nSay you have a list and you wanna loop that list, your code might look like so...\n\n```\nmyList = [\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"]\n\nfor letter in myList:\n    do something\n```\n\nHowever, it might make more sense to structure it like a sentence as you write it out.\n\nFor example the above example would be like so:\n\n```\nFor each letter in myList:\n    Do this\n```\n\nJust remember a for loop is generally used to run a piece of code each time for each occurrence of something.\n\nA while loop runs the same piece of code each time until a condition is met.\n\nObviously there are exceptions for both, but just starting out, it's a good way to view them. \n\nSo if you wanted to print hello ten times a while loop would be better. However, if you wanted to print each element in a list, a for loop would be the better option.",
            "Nothing you said is too concerning.  You should at points struggle with course work (you're learning it for the first time).  The key is to keep trying to understand it and be persistent.  \n\nTry learning it from a different source and medium.  By source don't just rely on your class textbook, try a different book (they may just explain it using a phrase that makes it all click for you).  By medium I mean if you've mostly used a textbook try watching a video on loops, or get a friend to explain it to you (or reddit).  These other mediums can trigger different parts of your brain to help it click.\n\nGood luck",
            "Don't quit because something is not immediately intuitive. \n\nAssuming you know that you want to become a computer programmer (which I think is a good idea), soak your brain in loops for a few weeks. \n\nThis means at least one hour of work understanding that subject every day, and more on the weekends. After a few weeks, let it stew for a week or so before revisiting it. This will allow your unconscious mind to digest the information.\n\nThere are many other strategies for learning!

            "I am trying to get something to convert screenshots of poker hand range matrices into a specific text format.\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/UjgNnIC](https://imgur.com/a/UjgNnIC)\n\nHere is an example of a screenshot. Each square represents the frequencies in which a player would raise (red) or call (black). Its tedious inputting the ranges into another program that takes in mouse clicks with a scroll wheel to change the frequency or you can enter the text. Like so:\n\n [https://imgur.com/a/2cyESQb](https://imgur.com/a/2cyESQb)\n\nAA-JJ,AKs,KQs,QJs,AKo,\\[90.0\\]AQs-AJs\\[/90.0\\],\\[75.0\\]TT-88\\[/75.0\\],\\[50.0\\]AQo,KQo\\[/50.0\\]\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo as you can see there are multiple problems I am having.\n\n1. Accurately reading the percentages of each square. The screenshots are about 600x600 and not every pixel is crisp so its difficult to code logic to say which pixel is red, black or grey.\n2. There needs to be some cleaning since ALL hands that are a specific frequency percentage need to be grouped together in between \\[xx.0\\] <hands, hands,>\\[/xx.0\\]. So I can't just go through a for loop with the associated hands and link the frequencies with the hand, I need another pass to get it organized into the specified format.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf anyone could help with discerning between rgb values of a low quality screenshot I'd be very grateful. Right now I'm taking the length of the image, dividing it by 13, taking the floor of that then looping through one square to take the ratio between rgb values in the pixel before it and if its close to 1 += a color count if not divide it by the length/13 (handsquarewidth) and adding it to a frequency dictionary. \n\nThe intermediary area sometimes is 3 or 4 pixels wide so it cuts down on the total frequency so i end up with for the AJs square  \\[0.425, 0.0, 0.525\\]. 42.5% raise, 0.0% due to the gradient area, and 52.5% call. Which doesn't look right because im doing 40 pixels for the hand square width which may not begin at the very start of the square and the gradient area cuts out some percents. It looks more like 35/65 to me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAny advice is welcomed.",

            "This article mentions it on the final section\u2014Coding With Pythonic Style: Replacing `map()`\u2014but what do ya'll stand on list comprehensions vs `map()`?\n\nPersonally I almost never use `map()`, and find comprehensions to be more readable, but wondering how other people approach it. I know that I've seen people that come from other languages reach for `map` pretty often.",
            "Map() is one of my favorite functions in python tbh",
            "I use `map` or `itertools.starmap` and `filter` when I already have the exact function I needed. This is a lot easier to read:\n\n    map(isoparse, birthdays)\n    filter(str.isalpha, names)\n\ncompared to:\n\n    [isoparse(bd) for bd in birthdays]\n    [nm for nm in names if nm.isalpha()]\n\nUsing `map` means I don't have to invent a meaningless loop variable like `bd` and `nm` that has to be repeated twice or thrice when using list comprehension. For most other cases I use list comprehension.\n\nIf you're defining functions/lambda just so you can use map, I think that is an anti pattern. You should just use list comprehension for those cases."

            "Conda is a sort of superset of PIP.  It handles dependencies outside of Python, which are necessary for some ML libraries, and manages the virtualenv.  Anaconda is a distribution of many commonly used packages which is easier to setup for those who aren\u2019t as technically inclined. I\u2019d recommend using conda for packaging any sort of ML related project.",
            "Installing scientific packages on Python used to be a pain, especially on non-Linux systems. Ananconda made it a lot easier. These days it's not really an issue.",
            "If you're doing web development or something, pip is fine.   If you're doing complex machine learning, the fact that Anaconda handles all dependency management and ensures compatibility among all the hundreds of packages in its distribution is a godsend.  Could you spend hours pip installing all that stuff yourself?   Sure.    But why?",
            "To add to what others have said, building numpy with MKL bindings on your own is an exercise in frustration. Conda just ships them together.\n\nI've also had much better experience running CI for compiled components on different operating systems through Conda instead of standard CPython.",
            "I remember having a horrible time installing the usual data analysis packages under Windows, until finding out it Just Worked with Anaconda.",
            "For a lot of people a dependable version and distribution matter. Some of us work on remote machines with managed software stacks that have no internet access. Anaconda gives you a whole distribution so you already know what is there from python version to package versions. This is good for users because you don't need to get a bunch of different versions of stuff manually. You can just use the anaconda distribution.",
            "Python 2 and the rapid development of python 3 is a significant factor driving anaconda usage.\n\nIf you can't trust the system python to be up to date enough to be able to install the other libraries you need from pip, then you are forced to build python from source.\n\nHaving to build python from source was the leading cause of suicides, and the national suicide prevention hotline created anaconda as a response.",
            "Other people all have good points. One that I want to add -- Conda is actually a package manager not only for Python, but also for C/C++, R, Ruby, Lua, ect.  Unlike pip, a lot of the packages installed in Conda are straight up binaries rather than python files. So heavy loading processes such as ML and data processing might run faster in Conda packages compared to Python packages.",
            "Some years ago, conda was the solution to the dependency problems people started to have in the science community. Say you have an old big python program that is not well maintained but used by some people, and that breaks with newer libraries. How do you run this thing without breaking the other newer scripts on the server?\n\nOr some data scientist shares a Jupiter notebook on the web that doesn\u2019t work for you because of some incompatible library. Easy to solve if they share the conda environment file, too.",
            "I don't use Conda much at all, but when I do, I am generally impressed. If you need a solid tool to manage both dependencies and Python versions, it is a good option. Especially if you are into data science. Especially if all the packages you need are in [the conda repository](https://anaconda.org/anaconda/repo).\n\nI haven't felt the need for the whole Anaconda distribution. Just Conda seems worth a try.\n\n_Plenty_ of other options for virtual environment, project and dependency management. [I wrote a rundown recently](https://dev.to/bowmanjd/python-tools-for-managing-virtual-environments-3bko), and I am sure I didn't cover them all. Summary, if you don't feel like reading: use [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/), [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/), or Conda, depending on your interests and needs.

            "Its the same with most companies and most languages.",
            "During your next job interview(and it sounds like there should be one soon) remember that while they are interviewing you, you should also be interviewing them. Ask to see an example of their \"best\" code AND an example of their \"worst\" code. If they refuse keep looking! If they say they have no bad code - they're lying. If they say yes ask to sit with one of their developers and walk thru a couple programs - ask the developer lots of questions -- by the end of an hour you'll know everything you need to know about the work environment and their values. This has saved me from hiring onto a death march more than once.",
            "I wouldn't call it \"Python fatigue\", it's more like a disease in the whole industry (not just software engineering, I'd say it affects every tech company). At home I have the newest hardware (well, not the newest, but usually not older than 2-5 years), most recent software (Archlinux, Fedora, yay), and can use whatever library I want, whatever coding style I want. I can write unit tests, I can run Gitlab instances with CI/CD, and so on.\n\nBut at work \u2026 I mean we still have machines running MS-DOS. We're using 2GB IDE disks and norton commander for making backups on those machines.\n\nA lot of people also don't understand that you can't write an app once and it will run forever. Software engineering, like mechanical and electrical engineering, requires maintenance. There are companies that understand that, and there are companies that don't. Try to find one that understands it.\n\nMy tl;dr is that many companies are currently in the process of changing and accepting that software engineering is not a one time thing. And if you want to improve code quality you absolutely need unit tests, and you need someone who maintains the code. And also, that they need to risk breaking a few things because the tests weren't good enough. Trying to deliver better software is \u2013 in my books \u2013 still better than not touching old code because we could break something.\n\nSo \u2026 yeah. I'm not sure if that helps you, just my point of view.",
            "My experience is that you'll see much the same thing in large enterprise codebases, to a greater or lesser extent, irrespective of which language you're working in. Certainly, the worst things I've seen in Java codebases are worse than the worst things I've seen in Python codebases.\n\nIt's also my experience that large enterprise-y open source projects are about as bad as large enterprise-y internal projects. For example, I've previously attempted to fix issues with Cobbler and Ansible, and (at the risk of causing controversy), found that both are at least as messed up as the internal project I was working on that used them. There's a certain amount of \"this project is my CV\" than motivates maintainers to keep smaller projects sane, but once a project becomes a product, it's subject to the same pointy-haired-boss nonsense as internal projects.\n\nSome languages have a bit less of this, mostly by virtue of being \"a bit weird\" (I'm thinking things like Erlang or Clojure), so only relatively confident developers would use them. But as soon as you've got a project that uses these languages in an organisation with bad hiring practices, you end up with a worse mess than you'd get if you'd used something boring like Java, as developers who don't know the language try and write code in it anyway - Ruby kinda went this way, when it want from being \"a hidden gem\", to \"hip\", to \"something people who look at Gartner quadrants want to try\", to \"the new PHP\".\n\nAll that said, if the problem is (say) that you've got a bunch of mediocre C# developers who are forced to write Python, and are insisting on writing C#-ish Python, maybe the answer is to just use C#. It's the path of least resistance, and I mention C# as it's a language that works well for mixed-ability teams.",

Some languages might be slightly more or less prone to particular types of abuse, but in every one it is possible to write horrible code.\n\nWhat you describe seems to caused by inadequate technical leadership at your company. A good technical leader should protect and promote efforts to improve code quality and to adopt best practices. The leader should allocate time for internal work that can be improve productivity in longer term, like refactorings or training. \n\nIf you can't improve your leaders (e.g. by being promoted to be one), then it is time find a better company.",

Kick off meeting for all the devs, the PM introduces the architecture team, and tells everyone that anyone who doesn't plan on following standards should leave now, and that during the project anyone who won't follow standards, or gives the arch or qa teams any grief about it, is going to be summarily walked.  Worked pretty well.\n\nNothing to do with language;all to do with culture and leadership.",

Thankfully I've found a job where my teammates share my opinion on how to write maintainable and clean code. I count myself VERY lucky. I still see a ton of bad code made by other teams in the company but at least I'm not turned down whenever I try to improve quality.",

            "Sounds like we work at the same company. Unfortunately, this seems to be a wide spread issue throughout the industry. You can either find another job where these code standards are valued, or you can try to push them harder on you current team. Maybe have a discussion with management? Unfortunately it seems quickly delivered \"working\" code will always be valued over more meticulous and slightly more time consuming code that is actually readable and standardized.",
            "A few of these things I can sympathize with your team on. I hate running flake8 and being told 400 times that my lines are 10 characters too long - that's not a problem with me, that's a problem with flake8. buried in the noise are a lot of \"variables defined and not used\" which is where all the real bugs are. if 5 times out of 10 it flagged what was basically a bug i'd feel better about it.\n\nI also look at some of these and see problems but not necessarily *big* problems - I don't like import * either but in every code base I've worked on where we've had it it's been the least of our problems so I wouldn't necessarily push it too hard (e.g. wouldnt' necessarily reject an otherwise decent pull request, although i'd comment). I never have it in my open source, but I kind of have to tolerate it and other things like it in commercial code otherwise a lot of production code would just never get deployed.\n\nI don't think you can apply the same rules in open source to commercial code. You're under different pressures and different constraints.\n\nThis isn't to say that code quality doesn't matter but I tend to find that you have to deal with it by identifying 10 problems and figuring out which is the biggest one for *all* of you and fix that rather than having a checklist of guidelines which you can mandate everybody follows or \"code doesn't get merged\". quality gates don't work when people aren't bought into them.\n\nIf they're rejecting the idea of making small changes where it's easy to understand the benefit, that's potentially a different story. i suspect they may be unconvinced of the benefit of many of these things though (& it will take some 'splainin to get them to see the light).",

Other things to do than just software development? The sad truth behind a lot of these problems is if you don't establish good behaviors as a baseline you can never get people to change.

            "I have some programming experience, but to learn python I decided to play around with list, tuples, and dictionaries.  To help me get used to them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is a very simple code meant to look through a list, and then delete negative elements.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm getting an error and when I print my list out, it doesn't make sense.  Am I missing something simple?\n\nHere's the code snippet:\n\nCode Snippet:  [https://imgur.com/X5nPyCv](https://imgur.com/X5nPyCv)\n\nHere's the output: [https://imgur.com/a/GWJHMkz](https://imgur.com/a/GWJHMkz)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you look at the output the first list that's printed out matches the global list that I created.  As I'm iterating through the list, the number 2 never appears, and the number -3 is printed out as 3.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAm I going nuts?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: I think I figured it out, I was modifying the array as I was pulling things out of it.  I've updated my code (using some google fu) to return just the elements of the list that are positive\n\nhere: https://imgur.com/s0ZBymZ",

            "It's better for everyone to move on, and whomever made the choice for the library would be either dragging people screaming and kicking into the new version, or leave a lot of outdated, and vulnerable code out there.\n\nBreak the code in same way to force people onto the new version or they'll be stupid and go with the last stable version and pray.\n\nI don't envy your position, but good luck.",
            "Not enough info to really answer the question.\n\nDo you use features of newer python versions? Does the developer team have the bandwidth to handle whatever work is involved in supporting older versions? \n\nIt comes down to balancing available resources vs resource cost to continue support.\n\nI can easily imagine two different libraries where the answer to the question about supporting older python versions is different because different projects have different amounts of available resources and different amounts of required resources to support older python versions.",
            "HEll YEAH it is.",
            "There isn't a single concept of \"dropping support\", there are many different ways you can execute a sunset policy:\n\n1. You can hard-drop support and start deliberately using new features everywhere and drop all compatibility shims so that won't work in older versions, reject any patches that restores support for older versions.\n\n2. You can drop explicit support for older versions, but keep a \"best-effort\" policy to merge patches that restore support if people made a PR that backports the library to older syntaxes\n\n3. You can drop explicit support for older versions, but don't actually try to actively break older versions, they just don't get tested and it'll only break when someday someone will submit a patch that breaks the older version.\n\n4. You can make a separate maintenance fork for the older versions, they won't get all the new features but if people make PRs on those branch to backport fixes or other features, they're welcome to do so and they will get merged like any others\n\nThere are infinitely many in the spectrum of sunset policy, but ultimately it's the maintainer's decision on what they are willing to spend time supporting on. If the maintainer works in company that uses the library for a mission critical software that still uses Python 2.7, they'd be unlikely to accept dropping support for it as long as that mission critical software is still running on the old version.\n\nIn any case, consider that people who don't upgrade their Python version probably are also fine not getting the latest updates from your library. If they're interested in bleeding edge, they'd have upgraded to Python 3 as well a long time ago.\n\nIf you're not the core maintainer of a project, you won't be making these decisions for them. They're the one that decides what they want to support. If they tell you your PR need to run on 2.7, you make sure they do if you're interested in getting it merged to the project. \n\nIf you're not happy with that situation, you can maintain your own fork, modernize the codebase in your own fork, and publish your own package; pretty much all FLOSS license allows you to do so. If you get enough people interested enough in the changes you're making, the crowd might start shifting to your fork and the two projects can live happily apart. Forked projects that becomes more popular than the original projects are relatively rare, but it happens from time to time.",

The study is supposed to learn you something, and if you're struggling to understand something but eventually do, it's learning you something.\n\nAlso, what is it that is causing you trouble with loops, maybe I(we on reddit) can help you if we know that?",
            "    my_items = [1, 2, 3]\n    for x in my_items:\n        print(x)\n\nLet's use a simple example. When a loop runs, you are \"iterating\" through each item in the list. The item is assigned to the variable x in the above example. The indented code is then executed. Once we get to the end of the block, the flow goes back to the \"for\" statement. The second value in the list is assigned to x and we execute the indented block of code. This repeats until we run out of items in the list. The flow then continues on with whatever code comes after. \n\nYou could manually write out the above loop, which would be\n\n    x = 1\n    print(x)\n    x = 2\n    print(x)\n    x = 3\n    print(x)\n\nBoth of these code examples will produce the same output. However, the second requires very explicit commands. What if you want a longer set of values, or different values? With the for loop, you can simply provide a new value for my_items and the loop will print each value in the list.",

However, I have taken this approach even in other languages I have learned.\n\nAn example:\n\nSay you have a list and you wanna loop that list, your code might look like so...\n\n```\nmyList = [\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"]\n\nfor letter in myList:\n    do something\n```\n\nHowever, it might make more sense to structure it like a sentence as you write it out.\n\nFor example the above example would be like so:\n\n```\nFor each letter in myList:\n    Do this\n```\n\nJust remember a for loop is generally used to run a piece of code each time for each occurrence of something.\n\nA while loop runs the same piece of code each time until a condition is met.\n\nObviously there are exceptions for both, but just starting out, it's a good way to view them. \n\nSo if you wanted to print hello ten times a while loop would be better. However, if you wanted to print each element in a list, a for loop would be the better option.",
            "Nothing you said is too concerning.  You should at points struggle with course work (you're learning it for the first time).  The key is to keep trying to understand it and be persistent.  \n\nTry learning it from a different source and medium.  By source don't just rely on your class textbook, try a different book (they may just explain it using a phrase that makes it all click for you).  By medium I mean if you've mostly used a textbook try watching a video on loops, or get a friend to explain it to you (or reddit).  These other mediums can trigger different parts of your brain to help it click.\n\nGood luck",
            "Don't quit because something is not immediately intuitive. \n\nAssuming you know that you want to become a computer programmer (which I think is a good idea), soak your brain in loops for a few weeks. \n\nThis means at least one hour of work understanding that subject every day, and more on the weekends. After a few weeks, let it stew for a week or so before revisiting it. This will allow your unconscious mind to digest the information.\n\nThere are many other strategies for learning! One of the most important is to determine your \"learning style\", then make sure you are using that to your advantage.",
            "Try to use a debugger to be able to visualize the state of the variable in the current scope. For instance :\n```\nx = 3\nfor i in range(10):\n    print(x)\n```\nIt's like saying print x 10 times\n\nWhat is also nice to know is that i is actually a variable (something that changes) that will contain 0,1,...,8,9\nIn computer science, we start at 0 =)\nSo if you were to do:\n```\nfor i in range(10):\n    print(i)\n```\nYou would get:\n0\n1\n2\n3\n.\n.\n.\n9\n\nNow what we call a for each in other programming language is when you iterate over all the element of a sequence (a list of element)\n```\nmy_list = [\"a\", \"g\", \"j\"]\nfor i in my_list:\n    print(i)\n```\nWill print :\na\ng\nj\n\nHope you'll understand better =)",

Give it some time, work through some stupid easy examples, it will come to you in time.\n\nA bit more detail on where you are struggling would be helpful.

            "I am trying to get something to convert screenshots of poker hand range matrices into a specific text format.\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/UjgNnIC](https://imgur.com/a/UjgNnIC)\n\nHere is an example of a screenshot. Each square represents the frequencies in which a player would raise (red) or call (black). Its tedious inputting the ranges into another program that takes in mouse clicks with a scroll wheel to change the frequency or you can enter the text. Like so:\n\n [https://imgur.com/a/2cyESQb](https://imgur.com/a/2cyESQb)\n\nAA-JJ,AKs,KQs,QJs,AKo,\\[90.0\\]AQs-AJs\\[/90.0\\],\\[75.0\\]TT-88\\[/75.0\\],\\[50.0\\]AQo,KQo\\[/50.0\\]\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo as you can see there are multiple problems I am having.\n\n1. Accurately reading the percentages of each square. The screenshots are about 600x600 and not every pixel is crisp so its difficult to code logic to say which pixel is red, black or grey.\n2. There needs to be some cleaning since ALL hands that are a specific frequency percentage need to be grouped together in between \\[xx.0\\] <hands, hands,>\\[/xx.0\\]. So I can't just go through a for loop with the associated hands and link the frequencies with the hand, I need another pass to get it organized into the specified format.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf anyone could help with discerning between rgb values of a low quality screenshot I'd be very grateful. Right now I'm taking the length of the image, dividing it by 13, taking the floor of that then looping through one square to take the ratio between rgb values in the pixel before it and if its close to 1 += a color count if not divide it by the length/13 (handsquarewidth) and adding it to a frequency dictionary. \n\nThe intermediary area sometimes is 3 or 4 pixels wide so it cuts down on the total frequency so i end up with for the AJs square  \\[0.425, 0.0, 0.525\\]. 42.5% raise, 0.0% due to the gradient area, and 52.5% call. Which doesn't look right because im doing 40 pixels for the hand square width which may not begin at the very start of the square and the gradient area cuts out some percents. It looks more like 35/65 to me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAny advice is welcomed.",

I know that I've seen people that come from other languages reach for `map` pretty often.",

This is a lot easier to read:\n\n    map(isoparse, birthdays)\n    filter(str.isalpha, names)\n\ncompared to:\n\n    [isoparse(bd) for bd in birthdays]\n    [nm for nm in names if nm.isalpha()]\n\nUsing `map` means I don't have to invent a meaningless loop variable like `bd` and `nm` that has to be repeated twice or thrice when using list comprehension. For most other cases I use list comprehension.\n\nIf you're defining functions/lambda just so you can use map, I think that is an anti pattern. You should just use list comprehension for those cases."

Could you spend hours pip installing all that stuff yourself?   Sure.    But why?",
            "To add to what others have said, building numpy with MKL bindings on your own is an exercise in frustration. Conda just ships them together.\n\nI've also had much better experience running CI for compiled components on different operating systems through Conda instead of standard CPython.",
            "I remember having a horrible time installing the usual data analysis packages under Windows, until finding out it Just Worked with Anaconda.",
            "For a lot of people a dependable version and distribution matter. Some of us work on remote machines with managed software stacks that have no internet access. Anaconda gives you a whole distribution so you already know what is there from python version to package versions. This is good for users because you don't need to get a bunch of different versions of stuff manually. You can just use the anaconda distribution.",
            "Python 2 and the rapid development of python 3 is a significant factor driving anaconda usage.\n\nIf you can't trust the system python to be up to date enough to be able to install the other libraries you need from pip, then you are forced to build python from source.\n\nHaving to build python from source was the leading cause of suicides, and the national suicide prevention hotline created anaconda as a response.",
            "Other people all have good points. One that I want to add -- Conda is actually a package manager not only for Python, but also for C/C++, R, Ruby, Lua, ect.  Unlike pip, a lot of the packages installed in Conda are straight up binaries rather than python files. So heavy loading processes such as ML and data processing might run faster in Conda packages compared to Python packages.",
            "Some years ago, conda was the solution to the dependency problems people started to have in the science community. Say you have an old big python program that is not well maintained but used by some people, and that breaks with newer libraries. How do you run this thing without breaking the other newer scripts on the server?\n\nOr some data scientist shares a Jupiter notebook on the web that doesn\u2019t work for you because of some incompatible library. Easy to solve if they share the conda environment file, too.",
            "I don't use Conda much at all, but when I do, I am generally impressed. If you need a solid tool to manage both dependencies and Python versions, it is a good option. Especially if you are into data science. Especially if all the packages you need are in [the conda repository](https://anaconda.org/anaconda/repo).\n\nI haven't felt the need for the whole Anaconda distribution. Just Conda seems worth a try.\n\n_Plenty_ of other options for virtual environment, project and dependency management. [I wrote a rundown recently](https://dev.to/bowmanjd/python-tools-for-managing-virtual-environments-3bko), and I am sure I didn't cover them all. Summary, if you don't feel like reading: use [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/), [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/), or Conda, depending on your interests and needs. Also, [Pyflow](https://github.com/David-OConnor/pyflow) is rather interesting.",
            "Because pip has a very poor dependency resolver, and because pip does not have the notion of dependency against compiled libraries outside the python ecosystem, something you care a lot to ensure you can deploy complex libraries without having them crash because you don't have libpng/mkl/vtk/whatnot",
            "The only reason i use anaconda is because when i tried to install python itself for some reason it did not work so i installed anaconda.",
            "I use pip. Pip is hope",
            "If you're on Linux, I wouldn't bother. Anaconda provides some benefit to Windows users, but it's a real pain to get it working. Our CI builds regularly fail due to conda issues, which is really annoying. It can be very slow to build and resolve a new environment, but some of the blame could be due to Windows (file locks, etc.).\n\nUsing conda on Linux though is just a world of pain for not much benefit. Stick with pip."

            "Have you thought about changing jobs?  There's a lot of SV tech companies hiring remote right now.",
            "Its the same with most companies and most languages.",
            "During your next job interview(and it sounds like there should be one soon) remember that while they are interviewing you, you should also be interviewing them. Ask to see an example of their \"best\" code AND an example of their \"worst\" code. If they refuse keep looking! If they say they have no bad code - they're lying. If they say yes ask to sit with one of their developers and walk thru a couple programs - ask the developer lots of questions -- by the end of an hour you'll know everything you need to know about the work environment and their values. This has saved me from hiring onto a death march more than once.",
            "I wouldn't call it \"Python fatigue\", it's more like a disease in the whole industry (not just software engineering, I'd say it affects every tech company). At home I have the newest hardware (well, not the newest, but usually not older than 2-5 years), most recent software (Archlinux, Fedora, yay), and can use whatever library I want, whatever coding style I want. I can write unit tests, I can run Gitlab instances with CI/CD, and so on.\n\nBut at work \u2026 I mean we still have machines running MS-DOS. We're using 2GB IDE disks and norton commander for making backups on those machines.\n\nA lot of people also don't understand that you can't write an app once and it will run forever. Software engineering, like mechanical and electrical engineering, requires maintenance. There are companies that understand that, and there are companies that don't. Try to find one that understands it.\n\nMy tl;dr is that many companies are currently in the process of changing and accepting that software engineering is not a one time thing. And if you want to improve code quality you absolutely need unit tests, and you need someone who maintains the code. And also, that they need to risk breaking a few things because the tests weren't good enough. Trying to deliver better software is \u2013 in my books \u2013 still better than not touching old code because we could break something.\n\nSo \u2026 yeah. I'm not sure if that helps you, just my point of view.",
            "My experience is that you'll see much the same thing in large enterprise codebases, to a greater or lesser extent, irrespective of which language you're working in. Certainly, the worst things I've seen in Java codebases are worse than the worst things I've seen in Python codebases.\n\nIt's also my experience that large enterprise-y open source projects are about as bad as large enterprise-y internal projects. For example, I've previously attempted to fix issues with Cobbler and Ansible, and (at the risk of causing controversy), found that both are at least as messed up as the internal project I was working on that used them. There's a certain amount of \"this project is my CV\" than motivates maintainers to keep smaller projects sane, but once a project becomes a product, it's subject to the same pointy-haired-boss nonsense as internal projects.\n\nSome languages have a bit less of this, mostly by virtue of being \"a bit weird\" (I'm thinking things like Erlang or Clojure), so only relatively confident developers would use them. But as soon as you've got a project that uses these languages in an organisation with bad hiring practices, you end up with a worse mess than you'd get if you'd used something boring like Java, as developers who don't know the language try and write code in it anyway - Ruby kinda went this way, when it want from being \"a hidden gem\", to \"hip\", to \"something people who look at Gartner quadrants want to try\", to \"the new PHP\".\n\nAll that said, if the problem is (say) that you've got a bunch of mediocre C# developers who are forced to write Python, and are insisting on writing C#-ish Python, maybe the answer is to just use C#. It's the path of least resistance, and I mention C# as it's a language that works well for mixed-ability teams.",

Some languages might be slightly more or less prone to particular types of abuse, but in every one it is possible to write horrible code.\n\nWhat you describe seems to caused by inadequate technical leadership at your company. A good technical leader should protect and promote efforts to improve code quality and to adopt best practices. The leader should allocate time for internal work that can be improve productivity in longer term, like refactorings or training. \n\nIf you can't improve your leaders (e.g. by being promoted to be one), then it is time find a better company.",

            "Down to project management I'm afraid, a lot of that stuff.  I remember the first largish programming project I worked on ( not python).  Numerous teams, including an architecture team.  Kick off meeting for all the devs, the PM introduces the architecture team, and tells everyone that anyone who doesn't plan on following standards should leave now, and that during the project anyone who won't follow standards, or gives the arch or qa teams any grief about it, is going to be summarily walked.  Worked pretty well.\n\nNothing to do with language;all to do with culture and leadership.",

I hoped that someone would tell me to stop and revert the changes (we had no code review) but nope. No one cared about that. That was the day when I realised that I need to find a new job. Thankfully I've found a job where my teammates share my opinion on how to write maintainable and clean code. I count myself VERY lucky. I still see a ton of bad code made by other teams in the company but at least I'm not turned down whenever I try to improve quality.",
            "Sounds like you have a bad team or company.",
            "Sounds like we work at the same company. Unfortunately, this seems to be a wide spread issue throughout the industry. You can either find another job where these code standards are valued, or you can try to push them harder on you current team. Maybe have a discussion with management? Unfortunately it seems quickly delivered \"working\" code will always be valued over more meticulous and slightly more time consuming code that is actually readable and standardized.",
            "A few of these things I can sympathize with your team on. I hate running flake8 and being told 400 times that my lines are 10 characters too long - that's not a problem with me, that's a problem with flake8. buried in the noise are a lot of \"variables defined and not used\" which is where all the real bugs are. if 5 times out of 10 it flagged what was basically a bug i'd feel better about it.\n\nI also look at some of these and see problems but not necessarily *big* problems - I don't like import * either but in every code base I've worked on where we've had it it's been the least of our problems so I wouldn't necessarily push it too hard (e.g. wouldnt' necessarily reject an otherwise decent pull request, although i'd comment). I never have it in my open source, but I kind of have to tolerate it and other things like it in commercial code otherwise a lot of production code would just never get deployed.\n\nI don't think you can apply the same rules in open source to commercial code. You're under different pressures and different constraints.\n\nThis isn't to say that code quality doesn't matter but I tend to find that you have to deal with it by identifying 10 problems and figuring out which is the biggest one for *all* of you and fix that rather than having a checklist of guidelines which you can mandate everybody follows or \"code doesn't get merged\". quality gates don't work when people aren't bought into them.\n\nIf they're rejecting the idea of making small changes where it's easy to understand the benefit, that's potentially a different story. i suspect they may be unconvinced of the benefit of many of these things though (& it will take some 'splainin to get them to see the light).",

Other things to do than just software development? The sad truth behind a lot of these problems is if you don't establish good behaviors as a baseline you can never get people to change.

Almost everything is now interactive!\n\nChoose how many hidden layers should be in your network along with the number of nodes in each layer. Once a dataset is selected (and noise is optionally added), the network is created.\n\nTrain the network in batches (with batchSize > 1) or on individual samples. Repeat the dataset 'n' times if you don't have enough samples (and don't care about overfitting). Stop training early if you want, or let it run to completion.\n\nWhen you finish, export the network (or import the results from an older run).\n\nWant to see how the network performs on your dataset? Run the 'Test Data' function to see the classification of every sample and a confusion matrix summarizing the results.\n\nLet me know what you think? Any improvements? The main goal is to create a learning app for seeing how different parameters affect the ability of MLPs to learn."

I have my YAML file, which I'll use to control the run of a python function at various time slots per weekday, like this:\n\n    --- # Polling Schedule\n    weekdays:\n      - weekday:\n          name: \"tuesday\"\n          start: \"21:22\"\n          end: \"23:23\"\n          interval: 5\n      - weekday:\n          name: \"thursday\"\n          start: \"20:00\"\n          end: \"21:00\"\n          interval: 5\n\nSo I fire a job at the start of the window to schedule the real job running at the interval and one at the end of the window to stop the interval job.\n\nJobs can be scheduled with a call like:\n\n    schedule.every().monday.at(\"09:00\").do(StartWindow, job=jobToSchedule, interval=value, tag=jobTag)\n\nand what I have works, except I have 7 if statements with, you guessed it\n\n    if dayname == 'monday':\n        schedule.every().monday.at(windowstart).do(...\n    \n    if dayname == 'tuesday':\n        schedule.every().tuesday.at(windowstart).do(...\n\nJust the job for a dictionary of function pointers thinks I, so I declare:\n\n    fndict = {\n        'monday':schedule.every().monday.at,\n        'tuesday':schedule.every().tuesday.at,\n    ...\n    }\n\nand instead of the if statements do:\n\n    fndict[dayname](windowStart).do(...\n\nAaand the scheduler swallows the call to the function pointer from the dictionary but the job never gets called, unlike the if statement version.\n\nAre there some subtleties I'm missing with python functions used in this way?\n\n\\[Code if you're interested\\]([https://github.com/bmrussell/yamlscheduler](https://github.com/bmrussell/yamlscheduler))"

            "It's better for everyone to move on, and whomever made the choice for the library would be either dragging people screaming and kicking into the new version, or leave a lot of outdated, and vulnerable code out there.\n\nBreak the code in same way to force people onto the new version or they'll be stupid and go with the last stable version and pray.\n\nI don't envy your position, but good luck.",
            "Not enough info to really answer the question.\n\nDo you use features of newer python versions? Does the developer team have the bandwidth to handle whatever work is involved in supporting older versions? \n\nIt comes down to balancing available resources vs resource cost to continue support.\n\nI can easily imagine two different libraries where the answer to the question about supporting older python versions is different because different projects have different amounts of available resources and different amounts of required resources to support older python versions.",
            "HEll YEAH it is.",
            "There isn't a single concept of \"dropping support\", there are many different ways you can execute a sunset policy:\n\n1. You can hard-drop support and start deliberately using new features everywhere and drop all compatibility shims so that won't work in older versions, reject any patches that restores support for older versions.\n\n2. You can drop explicit support for older versions, but keep a \"best-effort\" policy to merge patches that restore support if people made a PR that backports the library to older syntaxes\n\n3. You can drop explicit support for older versions, but don't actually try to actively break older versions, they just don't get tested and it'll only break when someday someone will submit a patch that breaks the older version.\n\n4. You can make a separate maintenance fork for the older versions, they won't get all the new features but if people make PRs on those branch to backport fixes or other features, they're welcome to do so and they will get merged like any others\n\nThere are infinitely many in the spectrum of sunset policy, but ultimately it's the maintainer's decision on what they are willing to spend time supporting on. If the maintainer works in company that uses the library for a mission critical software that still uses Python 2.7, they'd be unlikely to accept dropping support for it as long as that mission critical software is still running on the old version.\n\nIn any case, consider that people who don't upgrade their Python version probably are also fine not getting the latest updates from your library. If they're interested in bleeding edge, they'd have upgraded to Python 3 as well a long time ago.\n\nIf you're not the core maintainer of a project, you won't be making these decisions for them. They're the one that decides what they want to support. If they tell you your PR need to run on 2.7, you make sure they do if you're interested in getting it merged to the project. \n\nIf you're not happy with that situation, you can maintain your own fork, modernize the codebase in your own fork, and publish your own package; pretty much all FLOSS license allows you to do so. If you get enough people interested enough in the changes you're making, the crowd might start shifting to your fork and the two projects can live happily apart. Forked projects that becomes more popular than the original projects are relatively rare, but it happens from time to time.",

            "I am trying to get something to convert screenshots of poker hand range matrices into a specific text format.\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/UjgNnIC](https://imgur.com/a/UjgNnIC)\n\nHere is an example of a screenshot. Each square represents the frequencies in which a player would raise (red) or call (black). Its tedious inputting the ranges into another program that takes in mouse clicks with a scroll wheel to change the frequency or you can enter the text. Like so:\n\n [https://imgur.com/a/2cyESQb](https://imgur.com/a/2cyESQb)\n\nAA-JJ,AKs,KQs,QJs,AKo,\\[90.0\\]AQs-AJs\\[/90.0\\],\\[75.0\\]TT-88\\[/75.0\\],\\[50.0\\]AQo,KQo\\[/50.0\\]\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo as you can see there are multiple problems I am having.\n\n1. Accurately reading the percentages of each square. The screenshots are about 600x600 and not every pixel is crisp so its difficult to code logic to say which pixel is red, black or grey.\n2. There needs to be some cleaning since ALL hands that are a specific frequency percentage need to be grouped together in between \\[xx.0\\] <hands, hands,>\\[/xx.0\\]. So I can't just go through a for loop with the associated hands and link the frequencies with the hand, I need another pass to get it organized into the specified format.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf anyone could help with discerning between rgb values of a low quality screenshot I'd be very grateful. Right now I'm taking the length of the image, dividing it by 13, taking the floor of that then looping through one square to take the ratio between rgb values in the pixel before it and if its close to 1 += a color count if not divide it by the length/13 (handsquarewidth) and adding it to a frequency dictionary. \n\nThe intermediary area sometimes is 3 or 4 pixels wide so it cuts down on the total frequency so i end up with for the AJs square  \\[0.425, 0.0, 0.525\\]. 42.5% raise, 0.0% due to the gradient area, and 52.5% call. Which doesn't look right because im doing 40 pixels for the hand square width which may not begin at the very start of the square and the gradient area cuts out some percents. It looks more like 35/65 to me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAny advice is welcomed.",

This week I hope to finish up the dynamic unloading/reloading of users automation code and have a working MQTT handler (although not a complete one, but enough for simple events).  The hard part with the reloading of user code is that I have to carefully track all callbacks registered (and which module they came from) and unregister them or the user's old code will still be called when events happen.\n\nThis is a rather big project, I plan to post it to github once their is more functionality; however, if this project interests others and they want to help work on it let me know.",

I know that I've seen people that come from other languages reach for `map` pretty often.",
            "Map() is one of my favorite functions in python tbh",
            "I use `map` or `itertools.starmap` and `filter` when I already have the exact function I needed. This is a lot easier to read:\n\n    map(isoparse, birthdays)\n    filter(str.isalpha, names)\n\ncompared to:\n\n    [isoparse(bd) for bd in birthdays]\n    [nm for nm in names if nm.isalpha()]\n\nUsing `map` means I don't have to invent a meaningless loop variable like `bd` and `nm` that has to be repeated twice or thrice when using list comprehension. For most other cases I use list comprehension.\n\nIf you're defining functions/lambda just so you can use map, I think that is an anti pattern. You should just use list comprehension for those cases."

            "Conda is a sort of superset of PIP.  It handles dependencies outside of Python, which are necessary for some ML libraries, and manages the virtualenv.  Anaconda is a distribution of many commonly used packages which is easier to setup for those who aren\u2019t as technically inclined. I\u2019d recommend using conda for packaging any sort of ML related project.",
            "Installing scientific packages on Python used to be a pain, especially on non-Linux systems. Ananconda made it a lot easier. These days it's not really an issue.",
            "If you're doing web development or something, pip is fine.   If you're doing complex machine learning, the fact that Anaconda handles all dependency management and ensures compatibility among all the hundreds of packages in its distribution is a godsend.  Could you spend hours pip installing all that stuff yourself?   Sure.    But why?",
            "To add to what others have said, building numpy with MKL bindings on your own is an exercise in frustration. Conda just ships them together.\n\nI've also had much better experience running CI for compiled components on different operating systems through Conda instead of standard CPython.",
            "I remember having a horrible time installing the usual data analysis packages under Windows, until finding out it Just Worked with Anaconda.",
            "For a lot of people a dependable version and distribution matter. Some of us work on remote machines with managed software stacks that have no internet access. Anaconda gives you a whole distribution so you already know what is there from python version to package versions. This is good for users because you don't need to get a bunch of different versions of stuff manually. You can just use the anaconda distribution.",
            "Python 2 and the rapid development of python 3 is a significant factor driving anaconda usage.\n\nIf you can't trust the system python to be up to date enough to be able to install the other libraries you need from pip, then you are forced to build python from source.\n\nHaving to build python from source was the leading cause of suicides, and the national suicide prevention hotline created anaconda as a response.",
            "Other people all have good points. One that I want to add -- Conda is actually a package manager not only for Python, but also for C/C++, R, Ruby, Lua, ect.  Unlike pip, a lot of the packages installed in Conda are straight up binaries rather than python files. So heavy loading processes such as ML and data processing might run faster in Conda packages compared to Python packages.",
            "Some years ago, conda was the solution to the dependency problems people started to have in the science community. Say you have an old big python program that is not well maintained but used by some people, and that breaks with newer libraries. How do you run this thing without breaking the other newer scripts on the server?\n\nOr some data scientist shares a Jupiter notebook on the web that doesn\u2019t work for you because of some incompatible library. Easy to solve if they share the conda environment file, too.",
            "I don't use Conda much at all, but when I do, I am generally impressed. If you need a solid tool to manage both dependencies and Python versions, it is a good option. Especially if you are into data science. Especially if all the packages you need are in [the conda repository](https://anaconda.org/anaconda/repo).\n\nI haven't felt the need for the whole Anaconda distribution. Just Conda seems worth a try.\n\n_Plenty_ of other options for virtual environment, project and dependency management. [I wrote a rundown recently](https://dev.to/bowmanjd/python-tools-for-managing-virtual-environments-3bko), and I am sure I didn't cover them all. Summary, if you don't feel like reading: use [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/), [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/), or Conda, depending on your interests and needs. Also, [Pyflow](https://github.com/David-OConnor/pyflow) is rather interesting.",
            "Because pip has a very poor dependency resolver, and because pip does not have the notion of dependency against compiled libraries outside the python ecosystem, something you care a lot to ensure you can deploy complex libraries without having them crash because you don't have libpng/mkl/vtk/whatnot",

It can be very slow to build and resolve a new environment, but some of the blame could be due to Windows (file locks, etc.).\n\nUsing conda on Linux though is just a world of pain for not much benefit.

            "Have you thought about changing jobs?  There's a lot of SV tech companies hiring remote right now.",
            "Its the same with most companies and most languages.",
            "During your next job interview(and it sounds like there should be one soon) remember that while they are interviewing you, you should also be interviewing them. Ask to see an example of their \"best\" code AND an example of their \"worst\" code. If they refuse keep looking! If they say they have no bad code - they're lying. If they say yes ask to sit with one of their developers and walk thru a couple programs - ask the developer lots of questions -- by the end of an hour you'll know everything you need to know about the work environment and their values. This has saved me from hiring onto a death march more than once.",
            "I wouldn't call it \"Python fatigue\", it's more like a disease in the whole industry (not just software engineering, I'd say it affects every tech company). At home I have the newest hardware (well, not the newest, but usually not older than 2-5 years), most recent software (Archlinux, Fedora, yay), and can use whatever library I want, whatever coding style I want. I can write unit tests, I can run Gitlab instances with CI/CD, and so on.\n\nBut at work \u2026 I mean we still have machines running MS-DOS. We're using 2GB IDE disks and norton commander for making backups on those machines.\n\nA lot of people also don't understand that you can't write an app once and it will run forever. Software engineering, like mechanical and electrical engineering, requires maintenance. There are companies that understand that, and there are companies that don't. Try to find one that understands it.\n\nMy tl;dr is that many companies are currently in the process of changing and accepting that software engineering is not a one time thing. And if you want to improve code quality you absolutely need unit tests, and you need someone who maintains the code. And also, that they need to risk breaking a few things because the tests weren't good enough. Trying to deliver better software is \u2013 in my books \u2013 still better than not touching old code because we could break something.\n\nSo \u2026 yeah. I'm not sure if that helps you, just my point of view.",
            "My experience is that you'll see much the same thing in large enterprise codebases, to a greater or lesser extent, irrespective of which language you're working in. Certainly, the worst things I've seen in Java codebases are worse than the worst things I've seen in Python codebases.\n\nIt's also my experience that large enterprise-y open source projects are about as bad as large enterprise-y internal projects. For example, I've previously attempted to fix issues with Cobbler and Ansible, and (at the risk of causing controversy), found that both are at least as messed up as the internal project I was working on that used them. There's a certain amount of \"this project is my CV\" than motivates maintainers to keep smaller projects sane, but once a project becomes a product, it's subject to the same pointy-haired-boss nonsense as internal projects.\n\nSome languages have a bit less of this, mostly by virtue of being \"a bit weird\" (I'm thinking things like Erlang or Clojure), so only relatively confident developers would use them. But as soon as you've got a project that uses these languages in an organisation with bad hiring practices, you end up with a worse mess than you'd get if you'd used something boring like Java, as developers who don't know the language try and write code in it anyway - Ruby kinda went this way, when it want from being \"a hidden gem\", to \"hip\", to \"something people who look at Gartner quadrants want to try\", to \"the new PHP\".\n\nAll that said, if the problem is (say) that you've got a bunch of mediocre C# developers who are forced to write Python, and are insisting on writing C#-ish Python, maybe the answer is to just use C#. It's the path of least resistance, and I mention C# as it's a language that works well for mixed-ability teams.",

Some languages might be slightly more or less prone to particular types of abuse, but in every one it is possible to write horrible code.\n\nWhat you describe seems to caused by inadequate technical leadership at your company. A good technical leader should protect and promote efforts to improve code quality and to adopt best practices. The leader should allocate time for internal work that can be improve productivity in longer term, like refactorings or training. \n\nIf you can't improve your leaders (e.g. by being promoted to be one), then it is time find a better company.",

            "Down to project management I'm afraid, a lot of that stuff.  I remember the first largish programming project I worked on ( not python).  Numerous teams, including an architecture team.  Kick off meeting for all the devs, the PM introduces the architecture team, and tells everyone that anyone who doesn't plan on following standards should leave now, and that during the project anyone who won't follow standards, or gives the arch or qa teams any grief about it, is going to be summarily walked.  Worked pretty well.\n\nNothing to do with language;all to do with culture and leadership.",

I hoped that someone would tell me to stop and revert the changes (we had no code review) but nope. No one cared about that. That was the day when I realised that I need to find a new job. Thankfully I've found a job where my teammates share my opinion on how to write maintainable and clean code. I count myself VERY lucky. I still see a ton of bad code made by other teams in the company but at least I'm not turned down whenever I try to improve quality.",
            "Sounds like you have a bad team or company.",
            "Sounds like we work at the same company. Unfortunately, this seems to be a wide spread issue throughout the industry. You can either find another job where these code standards are valued, or you can try to push them harder on you current team. Maybe have a discussion with management? Unfortunately it seems quickly delivered \"working\" code will always be valued over more meticulous and slightly more time consuming code that is actually readable and standardized.",
            "A few of these things I can sympathize with your team on. I hate running flake8 and being told 400 times that my lines are 10 characters too long - that's not a problem with me, that's a problem with flake8. buried in the noise are a lot of \"variables defined and not used\" which is where all the real bugs are. if 5 times out of 10 it flagged what was basically a bug i'd feel better about it.\n\nI also look at some of these and see problems but not necessarily *big* problems - I don't like import * either but in every code base I've worked on where we've had it it's been the least of our problems so I wouldn't necessarily push it too hard (e.g. wouldnt' necessarily reject an otherwise decent pull request, although i'd comment). I never have it in my open source, but I kind of have to tolerate it and other things like it in commercial code otherwise a lot of production code would just never get deployed.\n\nI don't think you can apply the same rules in open source to commercial code. You're under different pressures and different constraints.\n\nThis isn't to say that code quality doesn't matter but I tend to find that you have to deal with it by identifying 10 problems and figuring out which is the biggest one for *all* of you and fix that rather than having a checklist of guidelines which you can mandate everybody follows or \"code doesn't get merged\". quality gates don't work when people aren't bought into them.\n\nIf they're rejecting the idea of making small changes where it's easy to understand the benefit, that's potentially a different story. i suspect they may be unconvinced of the benefit of many of these things though (& it will take some 'splainin to get them to see the light).",

I think it's just easy to get burnt out dealing with the same problems every day. That happens in most jobs though. Maybe a slight job change would help? Other things to do than just software development? The sad truth behind a lot of these problems is if you don't establish good behaviors as a baseline you can never get people to change. If you don't have linting and CI and reviews in place from the beginning you will never in a million years convince someone it's a good use of time.",

At another job they had some super over complicated code in ASP.NET and nobody was allowed to touch it except for some outside consultant who they paid who knows what to maintain it.\n\nI have worked at companies when I was a consultant that did not even have source control. We used a shared network drive. Another there was no build machine because the build was a specific developers laptop. One day that laptop died. No builds for what i believe was almost two months.

            "I have some programming experience, but to learn python I decided to play around with list, tuples, and dictionaries.  To help me get used to them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is a very simple code meant to look through a list, and then delete negative elements.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm getting an error and when I print my list out, it doesn't make sense.  Am I missing something simple?\n\nHere's the code snippet:\n\nCode Snippet:  [https://imgur.com/X5nPyCv](https://imgur.com/X5nPyCv)\n\nHere's the output: [https://imgur.com/a/GWJHMkz](https://imgur.com/a/GWJHMkz)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you look at the output the first list that's printed out matches the global list that I created.  As I'm iterating through the list, the number 2 never appears, and the number -3 is printed out as 3.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAm I going nuts?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: I think I figured it out, I was modifying the array as I was pulling things out of it.  I've updated my code (using some google fu) to return just the elements of the list that are positive\n\nhere: https://imgur.com/s0ZBymZ",

            "It's better for everyone to move on, and whomever made the choice for the library would be either dragging people screaming and kicking into the new version, or leave a lot of outdated, and vulnerable code out there.\n\nBreak the code in same way to force people onto the new version or they'll be stupid and go with the last stable version and pray.\n\nI don't envy your position, but good luck.",
            "Not enough info to really answer the question.\n\nDo you use features of newer python versions? Does the developer team have the bandwidth to handle whatever work is involved in supporting older versions? \n\nIt comes down to balancing available resources vs resource cost to continue support.\n\nI can easily imagine two different libraries where the answer to the question about supporting older python versions is different because different projects have different amounts of available resources and different amounts of required resources to support older python versions.",
            "HEll YEAH it is.",
            "There isn't a single concept of \"dropping support\", there are many different ways you can execute a sunset policy:\n\n1. You can hard-drop support and start deliberately using new features everywhere and drop all compatibility shims so that won't work in older versions, reject any patches that restores support for older versions.\n\n2. You can drop explicit support for older versions, but keep a \"best-effort\" policy to merge patches that restore support if people made a PR that backports the library to older syntaxes\n\n3. You can drop explicit support for older versions, but don't actually try to actively break older versions, they just don't get tested and it'll only break when someday someone will submit a patch that breaks the older version.\n\n4. You can make a separate maintenance fork for the older versions, they won't get all the new features but if people make PRs on those branch to backport fixes or other features, they're welcome to do so and they will get merged like any others\n\nThere are infinitely many in the spectrum of sunset policy, but ultimately it's the maintainer's decision on what they are willing to spend time supporting on. If the maintainer works in company that uses the library for a mission critical software that still uses Python 2.7, they'd be unlikely to accept dropping support for it as long as that mission critical software is still running on the old version.\n\nIn any case, consider that people who don't upgrade their Python version probably are also fine not getting the latest updates from your library. If they're interested in bleeding edge, they'd have upgraded to Python 3 as well a long time ago.\n\nIf you're not the core maintainer of a project, you won't be making these decisions for them. They're the one that decides what they want to support. If they tell you your PR need to run on 2.7, you make sure they do if you're interested in getting it merged to the project. \n\nIf you're not happy with that situation, you can maintain your own fork, modernize the codebase in your own fork, and publish your own package; pretty much all FLOSS license allows you to do so. If you get enough people interested enough in the changes you're making, the crowd might start shifting to your fork and the two projects can live happily apart. Forked projects that becomes more popular than the original projects are relatively rare, but it happens from time to time.",

Each square represents the frequencies in which a player would raise (red) or call (black). Its tedious inputting the ranges into another program that takes in mouse clicks with a scroll wheel to change the frequency or you can enter the text. Like so:\n\n [https://imgur.com/a/2cyESQb](https://imgur.com/a/2cyESQb)\n\nAA-JJ,AKs,KQs,QJs,AKo,\\[90.0\\]AQs-AJs\\[/90.0\\],\\[75.0\\]TT-88\\[/75.0\\],\\[50.0\\]AQo,KQo\\[/50.0\\]\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo as you can see there are multiple problems I am having.\n\n1. Accurately reading the percentages of each square. The screenshots are about 600x600 and not every pixel is crisp so its difficult to code logic to say which pixel is red, black or grey.\n2. There needs to be some cleaning since ALL hands that are a specific frequency percentage need to be grouped together in between \\[xx.0\\] <hands, hands,>\\[/xx.0\\]. So I can't just go through a for loop with the associated hands and link the frequencies with the hand, I need another pass to get it organized into the specified format.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf anyone could help with discerning between rgb values of a low quality screenshot I'd be very grateful. Right now I'm taking the length of the image, dividing it by 13, taking the floor of that then looping through one square to take the ratio between rgb values in the pixel before it and if its close to 1 += a color count if not divide it by the length/13 (handsquarewidth) and adding it to a frequency dictionary. \n\nThe intermediary area sometimes is 3 or 4 pixels wide so it cuts down on the total frequency so i end up with for the AJs square  \\[0.425, 0.0, 0.525\\]. 42.5% raise, 0.0% due to the gradient area, and 52.5% call. Which doesn't look right because im doing 40 pixels for the hand square width which may not begin at the very start of the square and the gradient area cuts out some percents. It looks more like 35/65 to me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAny advice is welcomed.",

This is a lot easier to read:\n\n    map(isoparse, birthdays)\n    filter(str.isalpha, names)\n\ncompared to:\n\n    [isoparse(bd) for bd in birthdays]\n    [nm for nm in names if nm.isalpha()]\n\nUsing `map` means I don't have to invent a meaningless loop variable like `bd` and `nm` that has to be repeated twice or thrice when using list comprehension.

You should just use list comprehension for those cases."

So you might as well use it for your scripting too, and not have to learn two things.\n\nOnce you have your feet wet, I would consider trying PyCharm (I use IntelliJ at work) because it can do a lot of cool stuff for you\u2014but it's really useful for _application development_, and if you're just scripting it will be massive overkill and you will either be paying for something you don't need or use (either monetarily or just memory overhead) or you'll be spending all day playing with the cool buttons rather than learning to program.",

            "Conda is a sort of superset of PIP.  It handles dependencies outside of Python, which are necessary for some ML libraries, and manages the virtualenv.  Anaconda is a distribution of many commonly used packages which is easier to setup for those who aren\u2019t as technically inclined. I\u2019d recommend using conda for packaging any sort of ML related project.",
            "Installing scientific packages on Python used to be a pain, especially on non-Linux systems. Ananconda made it a lot easier. These days it's not really an issue.",
            "If you're doing web development or something, pip is fine.   If you're doing complex machine learning, the fact that Anaconda handles all dependency management and ensures compatibility among all the hundreds of packages in its distribution is a godsend.  Could you spend hours pip installing all that stuff yourself?   Sure.    But why?",
            "To add to what others have said, building numpy with MKL bindings on your own is an exercise in frustration. Conda just ships them together.\n\nI've also had much better experience running CI for compiled components on different operating systems through Conda instead of standard CPython.",
            "I remember having a horrible time installing the usual data analysis packages under Windows, until finding out it Just Worked with Anaconda.",
            "For a lot of people a dependable version and distribution matter. Some of us work on remote machines with managed software stacks that have no internet access. Anaconda gives you a whole distribution so you already know what is there from python version to package versions. This is good for users because you don't need to get a bunch of different versions of stuff manually. You can just use the anaconda distribution.",
            "Python 2 and the rapid development of python 3 is a significant factor driving anaconda usage.\n\nIf you can't trust the system python to be up to date enough to be able to install the other libraries you need from pip, then you are forced to build python from source.\n\nHaving to build python from source was the leading cause of suicides, and the national suicide prevention hotline created anaconda as a response.",
            "Other people all have good points. One that I want to add -- Conda is actually a package manager not only for Python, but also for C/C++, R, Ruby, Lua, ect.  Unlike pip, a lot of the packages installed in Conda are straight up binaries rather than python files. So heavy loading processes such as ML and data processing might run faster in Conda packages compared to Python packages.",
            "Some years ago, conda was the solution to the dependency problems people started to have in the science community. Say you have an old big python program that is not well maintained but used by some people, and that breaks with newer libraries. How do you run this thing without breaking the other newer scripts on the server?\n\nOr some data scientist shares a Jupiter notebook on the web that doesn\u2019t work for you because of some incompatible library. Easy to solve if they share the conda environment file, too.",
            "I don't use Conda much at all, but when I do, I am generally impressed. If you need a solid tool to manage both dependencies and Python versions, it is a good option. Especially if you are into data science. Especially if all the packages you need are in [the conda repository](https://anaconda.org/anaconda/repo).\n\nI haven't felt the need for the whole Anaconda distribution. Just Conda seems worth a try.\n\n_Plenty_ of other options for virtual environment, project and dependency management. [I wrote a rundown recently](https://dev.to/bowmanjd/python-tools-for-managing-virtual-environments-3bko), and I am sure I didn't cover them all. Summary, if you don't feel like reading: use [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/), [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/), or Conda, depending on your interests and needs. Also, [Pyflow](https://github.com/David-OConnor/pyflow) is rather interesting.",
            "Because pip has a very poor dependency resolver, and because pip does not have the notion of dependency against compiled libraries outside the python ecosystem, something you care a lot to ensure you can deploy complex libraries without having them crash because you don't have libpng/mkl/vtk/whatnot",
            "The only reason i use anaconda is because when i tried to install python itself for some reason it did not work so i installed anaconda.",
            "I use pip. Pip is hope",
            "If you're on Linux, I wouldn't bother. Anaconda provides some benefit to Windows users, but it's a real pain to get it working. Our CI builds regularly fail due to conda issues, which is really annoying. It can be very slow to build and resolve a new environment, but some of the blame could be due to Windows (file locks, etc.).\n\nUsing conda on Linux though is just a world of pain for not much benefit. Stick with pip."

            "Its the same with most companies and most languages.",
            "During your next job interview(and it sounds like there should be one soon) remember that while they are interviewing you, you should also be interviewing them. Ask to see an example of their \"best\" code AND an example of their \"worst\" code. If they refuse keep looking! If they say they have no bad code - they're lying. If they say yes ask to sit with one of their developers and walk thru a couple programs - ask the developer lots of questions -- by the end of an hour you'll know everything you need to know about the work environment and their values. This has saved me from hiring onto a death march more than once.",
            "I wouldn't call it \"Python fatigue\", it's more like a disease in the whole industry (not just software engineering, I'd say it affects every tech company). At home I have the newest hardware (well, not the newest, but usually not older than 2-5 years), most recent software (Archlinux, Fedora, yay), and can use whatever library I want, whatever coding style I want. I can write unit tests, I can run Gitlab instances with CI/CD, and so on.\n\nBut at work \u2026 I mean we still have machines running MS-DOS. We're using 2GB IDE disks and norton commander for making backups on those machines.\n\nA lot of people also don't understand that you can't write an app once and it will run forever. Software engineering, like mechanical and electrical engineering, requires maintenance. There are companies that understand that, and there are companies that don't. Try to find one that understands it.\n\nMy tl;dr is that many companies are currently in the process of changing and accepting that software engineering is not a one time thing. And if you want to improve code quality you absolutely need unit tests, and you need someone who maintains the code. And also, that they need to risk breaking a few things because the tests weren't good enough. Trying to deliver better software is \u2013 in my books \u2013 still better than not touching old code because we could break something.\n\nSo \u2026 yeah. I'm not sure if that helps you, just my point of view.",
            "My experience is that you'll see much the same thing in large enterprise codebases, to a greater or lesser extent, irrespective of which language you're working in. Certainly, the worst things I've seen in Java codebases are worse than the worst things I've seen in Python codebases.\n\nIt's also my experience that large enterprise-y open source projects are about as bad as large enterprise-y internal projects. For example, I've previously attempted to fix issues with Cobbler and Ansible, and (at the risk of causing controversy), found that both are at least as messed up as the internal project I was working on that used them. There's a certain amount of \"this project is my CV\" than motivates maintainers to keep smaller projects sane, but once a project becomes a product, it's subject to the same pointy-haired-boss nonsense as internal projects.\n\nSome languages have a bit less of this, mostly by virtue of being \"a bit weird\" (I'm thinking things like Erlang or Clojure), so only relatively confident developers would use them. But as soon as you've got a project that uses these languages in an organisation with bad hiring practices, you end up with a worse mess than you'd get if you'd used something boring like Java, as developers who don't know the language try and write code in it anyway - Ruby kinda went this way, when it want from being \"a hidden gem\", to \"hip\", to \"something people who look at Gartner quadrants want to try\", to \"the new PHP\".\n\nAll that said, if the problem is (say) that you've got a bunch of mediocre C# developers who are forced to write Python, and are insisting on writing C#-ish Python, maybe the answer is to just use C#. It's the path of least resistance, and I mention C# as it's a language that works well for mixed-ability teams.",
            "What are they doing to abuse isinstance()?",
            "All problems you mentioned are not really related Python. Everything would happen with a different programming language, just details changed. Some languages might be slightly more or less prone to particular types of abuse, but in every one it is possible to write horrible code.\n\nWhat you describe seems to caused by inadequate technical leadership at your company. A good technical leader should protect and promote efforts to improve code quality and to adopt best practices. The leader should allocate time for internal work that can be improve productivity in longer term, like refactorings or training. \n\nIf you can't improve your leaders (e.g. by being promoted to be one), then it is time find a better company.",
            "Find a team that will last longer than 5 years. Adding bad code means you\u2019re going to end up with a loooottttt of technical debt.\n\nLower productivity? You don\u2019t have time to NOT fix code.",
            "Down to project management I'm afraid, a lot of that stuff.  I remember the first largish programming project I worked on ( not python).  Numerous teams, including an architecture team.  Kick off meeting for all the devs, the PM introduces the architecture team, and tells everyone that anyone who doesn't plan on following standards should leave now, and that during the project anyone who won't follow standards, or gives the arch or qa teams any grief about it, is going to be summarily walked.  Worked pretty well.\n\nNothing to do with language;all to do with culture and leadership.",
            "Others may not like my answer, but feel free to change tech stack too! 5 years is a lot, maybe you\u2019d feel a bit more refreshed working with other languages. I know that maintaining enterprise Python apps can be easily a nightmare, especially pre-3.6 type hints.",
            "The company is doomed. Leave.",
            "I've been in the same boat and one day I've just decided to refactor my code to have as many bad practice as I could fit in. I hoped that someone would tell me to stop and revert the changes (we had no code review) but nope. No one cared about that. That was the day when I realised that I need to find a new job. Thankfully I've found a job where my teammates share my opinion on how to write maintainable and clean code. I count myself VERY lucky. I still see a ton of bad code made by other teams in the company but at least I'm not turned down whenever I try to improve quality.",
            "Sounds like you have a bad team or company.",
            "Sounds like we work at the same company. Unfortunately, this seems to be a wide spread issue throughout the industry. You can either find another job where these code standards are valued, or you can try to push them harder on you current team. Maybe have a discussion with management? Unfortunately it seems quickly delivered \"working\" code will always be valued over more meticulous and slightly more time consuming code that is actually readable and standardized.",
            "A few of these things I can sympathize with your team on. I hate running flake8 and being told 400 times that my lines are 10 characters too long - that's not a problem with me, that's a problem with flake8. buried in the noise are a lot of \"variables defined and not used\" which is where all the real bugs are. if 5 times out of 10 it flagged what was basically a bug i'd feel better about it.\n\nI also look at some of these and see problems but not necessarily *big* problems - I don't like import * either but in every code base I've worked on where we've had it it's been the least of our problems so I wouldn't necessarily push it too hard (e.g. wouldnt' necessarily reject an otherwise decent pull request, although i'd comment). I never have it in my open source, but I kind of have to tolerate it and other things like it in commercial code otherwise a lot of production code would just never get deployed.\n\nI don't think you can apply the same rules in open source to commercial code. You're under different pressures and different constraints.\n\nThis isn't to say that code quality doesn't matter but I tend to find that you have to deal with it by identifying 10 problems and figuring out which is the biggest one for *all* of you and fix that rather than having a checklist of guidelines which you can mandate everybody follows or \"code doesn't get merged\". quality gates don't work when people aren't bought into them.\n\nIf they're rejecting the idea of making small changes where it's easy to understand the benefit, that's potentially a different story. i suspect they may be unconvinced of the benefit of many of these things though (& it will take some 'splainin to get them to see the light).",

Other things to do than just software development? The sad truth behind a lot of these problems is if you don't establish good behaviors as a baseline you can never get people to change. If you don't have linting and CI and reviews in place from the beginning you will never in a million years convince someone it's a good use of time.",

The function should return the take home pay owed to the employee as a floating point value rounded to two decimal places.\n\nThe normal work week is 40 hours, and the company pays employees \"time and a half\" for overtime. So, the total wages is the sum of regular wages and overtime wages. Regular wages are the hours worked (up to 40) times the hourly wage. Overtime wages are any hours over 40 times the hourly wage times 1.5.\n\nThe employee's take home pay is the total wages minus taxes and medical costs. Taxes are 20% of the total wages, and medical costs are 10% of the total wages.\n\nSuppose an employee makes $12.25 per hour and has worked 45 hours this week.

(I basically want this due to the requirements of the app I'm writing, rather than using cron etc)\n\nSo.

            "It's better for everyone to move on, and whomever made the choice for the library would be either dragging people screaming and kicking into the new version, or leave a lot of outdated, and vulnerable code out there.\n\nBreak the code in same way to force people onto the new version or they'll be stupid and go with the last stable version and pray.\n\nI don't envy your position, but good luck.",
            "Not enough info to really answer the question.\n\nDo you use features of newer python versions? Does the developer team have the bandwidth to handle whatever work is involved in supporting older versions? \n\nIt comes down to balancing available resources vs resource cost to continue support.\n\nI can easily imagine two different libraries where the answer to the question about supporting older python versions is different because different projects have different amounts of available resources and different amounts of required resources to support older python versions.",
            "HEll YEAH it is.",
            "There isn't a single concept of \"dropping support\", there are many different ways you can execute a sunset policy:\n\n1. You can hard-drop support and start deliberately using new features everywhere and drop all compatibility shims so that won't work in older versions, reject any patches that restores support for older versions.\n\n2. You can drop explicit support for older versions, but keep a \"best-effort\" policy to merge patches that restore support if people made a PR that backports the library to older syntaxes\n\n3. You can drop explicit support for older versions, but don't actually try to actively break older versions, they just don't get tested and it'll only break when someday someone will submit a patch that breaks the older version.\n\n4. You can make a separate maintenance fork for the older versions, they won't get all the new features but if people make PRs on those branch to backport fixes or other features, they're welcome to do so and they will get merged like any others\n\nThere are infinitely many in the spectrum of sunset policy, but ultimately it's the maintainer's decision on what they are willing to spend time supporting on. If the maintainer works in company that uses the library for a mission critical software that still uses Python 2.7, they'd be unlikely to accept dropping support for it as long as that mission critical software is still running on the old version.\n\nIn any case, consider that people who don't upgrade their Python version probably are also fine not getting the latest updates from your library. If they're interested in bleeding edge, they'd have upgraded to Python 3 as well a long time ago.\n\nIf you're not the core maintainer of a project, you won't be making these decisions for them. They're the one that decides what they want to support. If they tell you your PR need to run on 2.7, you make sure they do if you're interested in getting it merged to the project. \n\nIf you're not happy with that situation, you can maintain your own fork, modernize the codebase in your own fork, and publish your own package; pretty much all FLOSS license allows you to do so. If you get enough people interested enough in the changes you're making, the crowd might start shifting to your fork and the two projects can live happily apart. Forked projects that becomes more popular than the original projects are relatively rare, but it happens from time to time.",
            "My open source library has already dropped support for python 3.6.  Python 2.7 support is long gone.\n\nI\u2019m currently considering dropping python 3.7 given that it\u2019s EOL."

Each square represents the frequencies in which a player would raise (red) or call (black). Its tedious inputting the ranges into another program that takes in mouse clicks with a scroll wheel to change the frequency or you can enter the text. Like so:\n\n [https://imgur.com/a/2cyESQb](https://imgur.com/a/2cyESQb)\n\nAA-JJ,AKs,KQs,QJs,AKo,\\[90.0\\]AQs-AJs\\[/90.0\\],\\[75.0\\]TT-88\\[/75.0\\],\\[50.0\\]AQo,KQo\\[/50.0\\]\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo as you can see there are multiple problems I am having.\n\n1. Accurately reading the percentages of each square. The screenshots are about 600x600 and not every pixel is crisp so its difficult to code logic to say which pixel is red, black or grey.\n2. There needs to be some cleaning since ALL hands that are a specific frequency percentage need to be grouped together in between \\[xx.0\\] <hands, hands,>\\[/xx.0\\]. So I can't just go through a for loop with the associated hands and link the frequencies with the hand, I need another pass to get it organized into the specified format.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf anyone could help with discerning between rgb values of a low quality screenshot I'd be very grateful. Right now I'm taking the length of the image, dividing it by 13, taking the floor of that then looping through one square to take the ratio between rgb values in the pixel before it and if its close to 1 += a color count if not divide it by the length/13 (handsquarewidth) and adding it to a frequency dictionary. \n\nThe intermediary area sometimes is 3 or 4 pixels wide so it cuts down on the total frequency so i end up with for the AJs square  \\[0.425, 0.0, 0.525\\]. 42.5% raise, 0.0% due to the gradient area, and 52.5% call. Which doesn't look right because im doing 40 pixels for the hand square width which may not begin at the very start of the square and the gradient area cuts out some percents. It looks more like 35/65 to me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAny advice is welcomed.",

Having to select a number and click \"Shade\" seems odd to me. I wanted to select a color and then click a number, and have that shade applied to that number. Maybe a shade mode and a text mode, to do different things on clicking a number? Maybe an easy way to change the shade in the text editing box?\n\nCool project.",

Finding just the right month by its absolute number looks a little bit complicated.\n\nHow do plan to stay online \"forever\"?

So you might as well use it for your scripting too, and not have to learn two things.\n\nOnce you have your feet wet, I would consider trying PyCharm (I use IntelliJ at work) because it can do a lot of cool stuff for you\u2014but it's really useful for _application development_, and if you're just scripting it will be massive overkill and you will either be paying for something you don't need or use (either monetarily or just memory overhead) or you'll be spending all day playing with the cool buttons rather than learning to program.",

            "Conda is a sort of superset of PIP.  It handles dependencies outside of Python, which are necessary for some ML libraries, and manages the virtualenv.  Anaconda is a distribution of many commonly used packages which is easier to setup for those who aren\u2019t as technically inclined. I\u2019d recommend using conda for packaging any sort of ML related project.",
            "Installing scientific packages on Python used to be a pain, especially on non-Linux systems. Ananconda made it a lot easier. These days it's not really an issue.",
            "If you're doing web development or something, pip is fine.   If you're doing complex machine learning, the fact that Anaconda handles all dependency management and ensures compatibility among all the hundreds of packages in its distribution is a godsend.  Could you spend hours pip installing all that stuff yourself?   Sure.    But why?",
            "To add to what others have said, building numpy with MKL bindings on your own is an exercise in frustration. Conda just ships them together.\n\nI've also had much better experience running CI for compiled components on different operating systems through Conda instead of standard CPython.",
            "I remember having a horrible time installing the usual data analysis packages under Windows, until finding out it Just Worked with Anaconda.",
            "For a lot of people a dependable version and distribution matter. Some of us work on remote machines with managed software stacks that have no internet access. Anaconda gives you a whole distribution so you already know what is there from python version to package versions. This is good for users because you don't need to get a bunch of different versions of stuff manually. You can just use the anaconda distribution.",
            "Python 2 and the rapid development of python 3 is a significant factor driving anaconda usage.\n\nIf you can't trust the system python to be up to date enough to be able to install the other libraries you need from pip, then you are forced to build python from source.\n\nHaving to build python from source was the leading cause of suicides, and the national suicide prevention hotline created anaconda as a response.",
            "Other people all have good points. One that I want to add -- Conda is actually a package manager not only for Python, but also for C/C++, R, Ruby, Lua, ect.  Unlike pip, a lot of the packages installed in Conda are straight up binaries rather than python files. So heavy loading processes such as ML and data processing might run faster in Conda packages compared to Python packages.",
            "Some years ago, conda was the solution to the dependency problems people started to have in the science community. Say you have an old big python program that is not well maintained but used by some people, and that breaks with newer libraries. How do you run this thing without breaking the other newer scripts on the server?\n\nOr some data scientist shares a Jupiter notebook on the web that doesn\u2019t work for you because of some incompatible library. Easy to solve if they share the conda environment file, too.",
            "I don't use Conda much at all, but when I do, I am generally impressed. If you need a solid tool to manage both dependencies and Python versions, it is a good option. Especially if you are into data science. Especially if all the packages you need are in [the conda repository](https://anaconda.org/anaconda/repo).\n\nI haven't felt the need for the whole Anaconda distribution. Just Conda seems worth a try.\n\n_Plenty_ of other options for virtual environment, project and dependency management. [I wrote a rundown recently](https://dev.to/bowmanjd/python-tools-for-managing-virtual-environments-3bko), and I am sure I didn't cover them all. Summary, if you don't feel like reading: use [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/), [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/), or Conda, depending on your interests and needs. Also, [Pyflow](https://github.com/David-OConnor/pyflow) is rather interesting.",
            "Because pip has a very poor dependency resolver, and because pip does not have the notion of dependency against compiled libraries outside the python ecosystem, something you care a lot to ensure you can deploy complex libraries without having them crash because you don't have libpng/mkl/vtk/whatnot",
            "The only reason i use anaconda is because when i tried to install python itself for some reason it did not work so i installed anaconda.",
            "I use pip. Pip is hope",
            "If you're on Linux, I wouldn't bother. Anaconda provides some benefit to Windows users, but it's a real pain to get it working. Our CI builds regularly fail due to conda issues, which is really annoying. It can be very slow to build and resolve a new environment, but some of the blame could be due to Windows (file locks, etc.).\n\nUsing conda on Linux though is just a world of pain for not much benefit. Stick with pip."

Software engineering, like mechanical and electrical engineering, requires maintenance. There are companies that understand that, and there are companies that don't. Try to find one that understands it.\n\nMy tl;dr is that many companies are currently in the process of changing and accepting that software engineering is not a one time thing. And if you want to improve code quality you absolutely need unit tests, and you need someone who maintains the code. And also, that they need to risk breaking a few things because the tests weren't good enough. Trying to deliver better software is \u2013 in my books \u2013 still better than not touching old code because we could break something.\n\nSo \u2026 yeah. I'm not sure if that helps you, just my point of view.",
            "My experience is that you'll see much the same thing in large enterprise codebases, to a greater or lesser extent, irrespective of which language you're working in. Certainly, the worst things I've seen in Java codebases are worse than the worst things I've seen in Python codebases.\n\nIt's also my experience that large enterprise-y open source projects are about as bad as large enterprise-y internal projects. For example, I've previously attempted to fix issues with Cobbler and Ansible, and (at the risk of causing controversy), found that both are at least as messed up as the internal project I was working on that used them. There's a certain amount of \"this project is my CV\" than motivates maintainers to keep smaller projects sane, but once a project becomes a product, it's subject to the same pointy-haired-boss nonsense as internal projects.\n\nSome languages have a bit less of this, mostly by virtue of being \"a bit weird\" (I'm thinking things like Erlang or Clojure), so only relatively confident developers would use them. But as soon as you've got a project that uses these languages in an organisation with bad hiring practices, you end up with a worse mess than you'd get if you'd used something boring like Java, as developers who don't know the language try and write code in it anyway - Ruby kinda went this way, when it want from being \"a hidden gem\", to \"hip\", to \"something people who look at Gartner quadrants want to try\", to \"the new PHP\".\n\nAll that said, if the problem is (say) that you've got a bunch of mediocre C# developers who are forced to write Python, and are insisting on writing C#-ish Python, maybe the answer is to just use C#. It's the path of least resistance, and I mention C# as it's a language that works well for mixed-ability teams.",

A good technical leader should protect and promote efforts to improve code quality and to adopt best practices. The leader should allocate time for internal work that can be improve productivity in longer term, like refactorings or training. \n\nIf you can't improve your leaders (e.g. by being promoted to be one), then it is time find a better company.",

            "A few of these things I can sympathize with your team on. I hate running flake8 and being told 400 times that my lines are 10 characters too long - that's not a problem with me, that's a problem with flake8. buried in the noise are a lot of \"variables defined and not used\" which is where all the real bugs are. if 5 times out of 10 it flagged what was basically a bug i'd feel better about it.\n\nI also look at some of these and see problems but not necessarily *big* problems - I don't like import * either but in every code base I've worked on where we've had it it's been the least of our problems so I wouldn't necessarily push it too hard (e.g. wouldnt' necessarily reject an otherwise decent pull request, although i'd comment). I never have it in my open source, but I kind of have to tolerate it and other things like it in commercial code otherwise a lot of production code would just never get deployed.\n\nI don't think you can apply the same rules in open source to commercial code. You're under different pressures and different constraints.\n\nThis isn't to say that code quality doesn't matter but I tend to find that you have to deal with it by identifying 10 problems and figuring out which is the biggest one for *all* of you and fix that rather than having a checklist of guidelines which you can mandate everybody follows or \"code doesn't get merged\". quality gates don't work when people aren't bought into them.\n\nIf they're rejecting the idea of making small changes where it's easy to understand the benefit, that's potentially a different story. i suspect they may be unconvinced of the benefit of many of these things though (& it will take some 'splainin to get them to see the light).",

            "It's better for everyone to move on, and whomever made the choice for the library would be either dragging people screaming and kicking into the new version, or leave a lot of outdated, and vulnerable code out there.\n\nBreak the code in same way to force people onto the new version or they'll be stupid and go with the last stable version and pray.\n\nI don't envy your position, but good luck.",
            "Not enough info to really answer the question.\n\nDo you use features of newer python versions? Does the developer team have the bandwidth to handle whatever work is involved in supporting older versions? \n\nIt comes down to balancing available resources vs resource cost to continue support.\n\nI can easily imagine two different libraries where the answer to the question about supporting older python versions is different because different projects have different amounts of available resources and different amounts of required resources to support older python versions.",
            "HEll YEAH it is.",
            "There isn't a single concept of \"dropping support\", there are many different ways you can execute a sunset policy:\n\n1. You can hard-drop support and start deliberately using new features everywhere and drop all compatibility shims so that won't work in older versions, reject any patches that restores support for older versions.\n\n2. You can drop explicit support for older versions, but keep a \"best-effort\" policy to merge patches that restore support if people made a PR that backports the library to older syntaxes\n\n3. You can drop explicit support for older versions, but don't actually try to actively break older versions, they just don't get tested and it'll only break when someday someone will submit a patch that breaks the older version.\n\n4. You can make a separate maintenance fork for the older versions, they won't get all the new features but if people make PRs on those branch to backport fixes or other features, they're welcome to do so and they will get merged like any others\n\nThere are infinitely many in the spectrum of sunset policy, but ultimately it's the maintainer's decision on what they are willing to spend time supporting on. If the maintainer works in company that uses the library for a mission critical software that still uses Python 2.7, they'd be unlikely to accept dropping support for it as long as that mission critical software is still running on the old version.\n\nIn any case, consider that people who don't upgrade their Python version probably are also fine not getting the latest updates from your library. If they're interested in bleeding edge, they'd have upgraded to Python 3 as well a long time ago.\n\nIf you're not the core maintainer of a project, you won't be making these decisions for them. They're the one that decides what they want to support. If they tell you your PR need to run on 2.7, you make sure they do if you're interested in getting it merged to the project. \n\nIf you're not happy with that situation, you can maintain your own fork, modernize the codebase in your own fork, and publish your own package; pretty much all FLOSS license allows you to do so. If you get enough people interested enough in the changes you're making, the crowd might start shifting to your fork and the two projects can live happily apart. Forked projects that becomes more popular than the original projects are relatively rare, but it happens from time to time.",

Each square represents the frequencies in which a player would raise (red) or call (black). Its tedious inputting the ranges into another program that takes in mouse clicks with a scroll wheel to change the frequency or you can enter the text. Like so:\n\n [https://imgur.com/a/2cyESQb](https://imgur.com/a/2cyESQb)\n\nAA-JJ,AKs,KQs,QJs,AKo,\\[90.0\\]AQs-AJs\\[/90.0\\],\\[75.0\\]TT-88\\[/75.0\\],\\[50.0\\]AQo,KQo\\[/50.0\\]\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo as you can see there are multiple problems I am having.\n\n1. Accurately reading the percentages of each square. The screenshots are about 600x600 and not every pixel is crisp so its difficult to code logic to say which pixel is red, black or grey.\n2. There needs to be some cleaning since ALL hands that are a specific frequency percentage need to be grouped together in between \\[xx.0\\] <hands, hands,>\\[/xx.0\\]. So I can't just go through a for loop with the associated hands and link the frequencies with the hand, I need another pass to get it organized into the specified format.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf anyone could help with discerning between rgb values of a low quality screenshot I'd be very grateful. Right now I'm taking the length of the image, dividing it by 13, taking the floor of that then looping through one square to take the ratio between rgb values in the pixel before it and if its close to 1 += a color count if not divide it by the length/13 (handsquarewidth) and adding it to a frequency dictionary. \n\nThe intermediary area sometimes is 3 or 4 pixels wide so it cuts down on the total frequency so i end up with for the AJs square  \\[0.425, 0.0, 0.525\\]. 42.5% raise, 0.0% due to the gradient area, and 52.5% call. Which doesn't look right because im doing 40 pixels for the hand square width which may not begin at the very start of the square and the gradient area cuts out some percents. It looks more like 35/65 to me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAny advice is welcomed.",

So it's good to be familiar editing with editing text from the shell-based text editor rather than getting used to IDEs that you can't use when doing pentest.\n\nYou probably can't or won't be bringing your own fully decked out vimrc when shelling into some servers (and I do recommend getting things setup nicely for your local environment), but you can go a very long way even with just vim at default settings without any plugins.",

When you are actually programming, you can go to a different IDE.to program",

Since you're doing security, I would consider using vim (I hate typing this, as an emacs guy) but vi will be there on every system you ever need to access and works great remote. So you might as well use it for your scripting too, and not have to learn two things.\n\nOnce you have your feet wet, I would consider trying PyCharm (I use IntelliJ at work) because it can do a lot of cool stuff for you\u2014but it's really useful for _application development_, and if you're just scripting it will be massive overkill and you will either be paying for something you don't need or use (either monetarily or just memory overhead) or you'll be spending all day playing with the cool buttons rather than learning to program.",

            "Conda is a sort of superset of PIP.  It handles dependencies outside of Python, which are necessary for some ML libraries, and manages the virtualenv.  Anaconda is a distribution of many commonly used packages which is easier to setup for those who aren\u2019t as technically inclined. I\u2019d recommend using conda for packaging any sort of ML related project.",
            "Installing scientific packages on Python used to be a pain, especially on non-Linux systems. Ananconda made it a lot easier. These days it's not really an issue.",
            "If you're doing web development or something, pip is fine.   If you're doing complex machine learning, the fact that Anaconda handles all dependency management and ensures compatibility among all the hundreds of packages in its distribution is a godsend.  Could you spend hours pip installing all that stuff yourself?   Sure.    But why?",
            "To add to what others have said, building numpy with MKL bindings on your own is an exercise in frustration. Conda just ships them together.\n\nI've also had much better experience running CI for compiled components on different operating systems through Conda instead of standard CPython.",
            "I remember having a horrible time installing the usual data analysis packages under Windows, until finding out it Just Worked with Anaconda.",
            "For a lot of people a dependable version and distribution matter. Some of us work on remote machines with managed software stacks that have no internet access. Anaconda gives you a whole distribution so you already know what is there from python version to package versions. This is good for users because you don't need to get a bunch of different versions of stuff manually. You can just use the anaconda distribution.",
            "Python 2 and the rapid development of python 3 is a significant factor driving anaconda usage.\n\nIf you can't trust the system python to be up to date enough to be able to install the other libraries you need from pip, then you are forced to build python from source.\n\nHaving to build python from source was the leading cause of suicides, and the national suicide prevention hotline created anaconda as a response.",
            "Other people all have good points. One that I want to add -- Conda is actually a package manager not only for Python, but also for C/C++, R, Ruby, Lua, ect.  Unlike pip, a lot of the packages installed in Conda are straight up binaries rather than python files. So heavy loading processes such as ML and data processing might run faster in Conda packages compared to Python packages.",
            "Some years ago, conda was the solution to the dependency problems people started to have in the science community. Say you have an old big python program that is not well maintained but used by some people, and that breaks with newer libraries. How do you run this thing without breaking the other newer scripts on the server?\n\nOr some data scientist shares a Jupiter notebook on the web that doesn\u2019t work for you because of some incompatible library. Easy to solve if they share the conda environment file, too.",
            "I don't use Conda much at all, but when I do, I am generally impressed. If you need a solid tool to manage both dependencies and Python versions, it is a good option. Especially if you are into data science. Especially if all the packages you need are in [the conda repository](https://anaconda.org/anaconda/repo).\n\nI haven't felt the need for the whole Anaconda distribution. Just Conda seems worth a try.\n\n_Plenty_ of other options for virtual environment, project and dependency management. [I wrote a rundown recently](https://dev.to/bowmanjd/python-tools-for-managing-virtual-environments-3bko), and I am sure I didn't cover them all. Summary, if you don't feel like reading: use [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/), [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/), or Conda, depending on your interests and needs. Also, [Pyflow](https://github.com/David-OConnor/pyflow) is rather interesting.",
            "Because pip has a very poor dependency resolver, and because pip does not have the notion of dependency against compiled libraries outside the python ecosystem, something you care a lot to ensure you can deploy complex libraries without having them crash because you don't have libpng/mkl/vtk/whatnot",
            "The only reason i use anaconda is because when i tried to install python itself for some reason it did not work so i installed anaconda.",
            "I use pip. Pip is hope",
            "If you're on Linux, I wouldn't bother. Anaconda provides some benefit to Windows users, but it's a real pain to get it working. Our CI builds regularly fail due to conda issues, which is really annoying. It can be very slow to build and resolve a new environment, but some of the blame could be due to Windows (file locks, etc.).\n\nUsing conda on Linux though is just a world of pain for not much benefit. Stick with pip."

Ask to see an example of their \"best\" code AND an example of their \"worst\" code. If they refuse keep looking! If they say they have no bad code - they're lying. If they say yes ask to sit with one of their developers and walk thru a couple programs - ask the developer lots of questions -- by the end of an hour you'll know everything you need to know about the work environment and their values. This has saved me from hiring onto a death march more than once.",
            "I wouldn't call it \"Python fatigue\", it's more like a disease in the whole industry (not just software engineering, I'd say it affects every tech company). At home I have the newest hardware (well, not the newest, but usually not older than 2-5 years), most recent software (Archlinux, Fedora, yay), and can use whatever library I want, whatever coding style I want. I can write unit tests, I can run Gitlab instances with CI/CD, and so on.\n\nBut at work \u2026 I mean we still have machines running MS-DOS. We're using 2GB IDE disks and norton commander for making backups on those machines.\n\nA lot of people also don't understand that you can't write an app once and it will run forever. Software engineering, like mechanical and electrical engineering, requires maintenance. There are companies that understand that, and there are companies that don't. Try to find one that understands it.\n\nMy tl;dr is that many companies are currently in the process of changing and accepting that software engineering is not a one time thing. And if you want to improve code quality you absolutely need unit tests, and you need someone who maintains the code. And also, that they need to risk breaking a few things because the tests weren't good enough. Trying to deliver better software is \u2013 in my books \u2013 still better than not touching old code because we could break something.\n\nSo \u2026 yeah. I'm not sure if that helps you, just my point of view.",
            "My experience is that you'll see much the same thing in large enterprise codebases, to a greater or lesser extent, irrespective of which language you're working in. Certainly, the worst things I've seen in Java codebases are worse than the worst things I've seen in Python codebases.\n\nIt's also my experience that large enterprise-y open source projects are about as bad as large enterprise-y internal projects. For example, I've previously attempted to fix issues with Cobbler and Ansible, and (at the risk of causing controversy), found that both are at least as messed up as the internal project I was working on that used them. There's a certain amount of \"this project is my CV\" than motivates maintainers to keep smaller projects sane, but once a project becomes a product, it's subject to the same pointy-haired-boss nonsense as internal projects.\n\nSome languages have a bit less of this, mostly by virtue of being \"a bit weird\" (I'm thinking things like Erlang or Clojure), so only relatively confident developers would use them. But as soon as you've got a project that uses these languages in an organisation with bad hiring practices, you end up with a worse mess than you'd get if you'd used something boring like Java, as developers who don't know the language try and write code in it anyway - Ruby kinda went this way, when it want from being \"a hidden gem\", to \"hip\", to \"something people who look at Gartner quadrants want to try\", to \"the new PHP\".\n\nAll that said, if the problem is (say) that you've got a bunch of mediocre C# developers who are forced to write Python, and are insisting on writing C#-ish Python, maybe the answer is to just use C#. It's the path of least resistance, and I mention C# as it's a language that works well for mixed-ability teams.",

A good technical leader should protect and promote efforts to improve code quality and to adopt best practices. The leader should allocate time for internal work that can be improve productivity in longer term, like refactorings or training. \n\nIf you can't improve your leaders (e.g. by being promoted to be one), then it is time find a better company.",

            "A few of these things I can sympathize with your team on. I hate running flake8 and being told 400 times that my lines are 10 characters too long - that's not a problem with me, that's a problem with flake8. buried in the noise are a lot of \"variables defined and not used\" which is where all the real bugs are. if 5 times out of 10 it flagged what was basically a bug i'd feel better about it.\n\nI also look at some of these and see problems but not necessarily *big* problems - I don't like import * either but in every code base I've worked on where we've had it it's been the least of our problems so I wouldn't necessarily push it too hard (e.g. wouldnt' necessarily reject an otherwise decent pull request, although i'd comment). I never have it in my open source, but I kind of have to tolerate it and other things like it in commercial code otherwise a lot of production code would just never get deployed.\n\nI don't think you can apply the same rules in open source to commercial code. You're under different pressures and different constraints.\n\nThis isn't to say that code quality doesn't matter but I tend to find that you have to deal with it by identifying 10 problems and figuring out which is the biggest one for *all* of you and fix that rather than having a checklist of guidelines which you can mandate everybody follows or \"code doesn't get merged\". quality gates don't work when people aren't bought into them.\n\nIf they're rejecting the idea of making small changes where it's easy to understand the benefit, that's potentially a different story. i suspect they may be unconvinced of the benefit of many of these things though (& it will take some 'splainin to get them to see the light).",

So, the total wages is the sum of regular wages and overtime wages. Regular wages are the hours worked (up to 40) times the hourly wage. Overtime wages are any hours over 40 times the hourly wage times 1.5.\n\nThe employee's take home pay is the total wages minus taxes and medical costs. Taxes are 20% of the total wages, and medical costs are 10% of the total wages.\n\nSuppose an employee makes $12.25 per hour and has worked 45 hours this week.

            "So. Function pointers. I'm fairly new to Python. Not to programming. Hence advanced question.\n\nI'm writing a singleton wrapper class for Dan Bader's excelent [in-process scheduler](https://github.com/dbader/schedule) that I can drive from a YAML file. (I basically want this due to the requirements of the app I'm writing, rather than using cron etc)\n\nSo. I have my YAML file, which I'll use to control the run of a python function at various time slots per weekday, like this:\n\n    --- # Polling Schedule\n    weekdays:\n      - weekday:\n          name: \"tuesday\"\n          start: \"21:22\"\n          end: \"23:23\"\n          interval: 5\n      - weekday:\n          name: \"thursday\"\n          start: \"20:00\"\n          end: \"21:00\"\n          interval: 5\n\nSo I fire a job at the start of the window to schedule the real job running at the interval and one at the end of the window to stop the interval job.\n\nJobs can be scheduled with a call like:\n\n    schedule.every().monday.at(\"09:00\").do(StartWindow, job=jobToSchedule, interval=value, tag=jobTag)\n\nand what I have works, except I have 7 if statements with, you guessed it\n\n    if dayname == 'monday':\n        schedule.every().monday.at(windowstart).do(...\n    \n    if dayname == 'tuesday':\n        schedule.every().tuesday.at(windowstart).do(...\n\nJust the job for a dictionary of function pointers thinks I, so I declare:\n\n    fndict = {\n        'monday':schedule.every().monday.at,\n        'tuesday':schedule.every().tuesday.at,\n    ...\n    }\n\nand instead of the if statements do:\n\n    fndict[dayname](windowStart).do(...\n\nAaand the scheduler swallows the call to the function pointer from the dictionary but the job never gets called, unlike the if statement version.\n\nAre there some subtleties I'm missing with python functions used in this way?\n\n\\[Code if you're interested\\]([https://github.com/bmrussell/yamlscheduler](https://github.com/bmrussell/yamlscheduler))"

            "Not enough info to really answer the question.\n\nDo you use features of newer python versions? Does the developer team have the bandwidth to handle whatever work is involved in supporting older versions? \n\nIt comes down to balancing available resources vs resource cost to continue support.\n\nI can easily imagine two different libraries where the answer to the question about supporting older python versions is different because different projects have different amounts of available resources and different amounts of required resources to support older python versions.",
            "HEll YEAH it is.",
            "There isn't a single concept of \"dropping support\", there are many different ways you can execute a sunset policy:\n\n1. You can hard-drop support and start deliberately using new features everywhere and drop all compatibility shims so that won't work in older versions, reject any patches that restores support for older versions.\n\n2. You can drop explicit support for older versions, but keep a \"best-effort\" policy to merge patches that restore support if people made a PR that backports the library to older syntaxes\n\n3. You can drop explicit support for older versions, but don't actually try to actively break older versions, they just don't get tested and it'll only break when someday someone will submit a patch that breaks the older version.\n\n4. You can make a separate maintenance fork for the older versions, they won't get all the new features but if people make PRs on those branch to backport fixes or other features, they're welcome to do so and they will get merged like any others\n\nThere are infinitely many in the spectrum of sunset policy, but ultimately it's the maintainer's decision on what they are willing to spend time supporting on. If the maintainer works in company that uses the library for a mission critical software that still uses Python 2.7, they'd be unlikely to accept dropping support for it as long as that mission critical software is still running on the old version.\n\nIn any case, consider that people who don't upgrade their Python version probably are also fine not getting the latest updates from your library. If they're interested in bleeding edge, they'd have upgraded to Python 3 as well a long time ago.\n\nIf you're not the core maintainer of a project, you won't be making these decisions for them. They're the one that decides what they want to support. If they tell you your PR need to run on 2.7, you make sure they do if you're interested in getting it merged to the project. \n\nIf you're not happy with that situation, you can maintain your own fork, modernize the codebase in your own fork, and publish your own package; pretty much all FLOSS license allows you to do so. If you get enough people interested enough in the changes you're making, the crowd might start shifting to your fork and the two projects can live happily apart. Forked projects that becomes more popular than the original projects are relatively rare, but it happens from time to time.",

            "While learning/studying it's normal for something to not be intuitive. If everything is directly clear to you then is the study really worth the time? The study is supposed to learn you something, and if you're struggling to understand something but eventually do, it's learning you something.\n\nAlso, what is it that is causing you trouble with loops, maybe I(we on reddit) can help you if we know that?",
            "    my_items = [1, 2, 3]\n    for x in my_items:\n        print(x)\n\nLet's use a simple example. When a loop runs, you are \"iterating\" through each item in the list. The item is assigned to the variable x in the above example. The indented code is then executed. Once we get to the end of the block, the flow goes back to the \"for\" statement. The second value in the list is assigned to x and we execute the indented block of code. This repeats until we run out of items in the list. The flow then continues on with whatever code comes after. \n\nYou could manually write out the above loop, which would be\n\n    x = 1\n    print(x)\n    x = 2\n    print(x)\n    x = 3\n    print(x)\n\nBoth of these code examples will produce the same output. However, the second requires very explicit commands. What if you want a longer set of values, or different values? With the for loop, you can simply provide a new value for my_items and the loop will print each value in the list.",
            "What exactly are you having trouble with?",
            "The best thing that ever helped me out with loops was sounding my loops out in my head as sentences. Python is really great to start that with because it is a coding language that is very close to the English language and how we structure words and sentences. (At least that's how I feel). However, I have taken this approach even in other languages I have learned.\n\nAn example:\n\nSay you have a list and you wanna loop that list, your code might look like so...\n\n```\nmyList = [\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"]\n\nfor letter in myList:\n    do something\n```\n\nHowever, it might make more sense to structure it like a sentence as you write it out.\n\nFor example the above example would be like so:\n\n```\nFor each letter in myList:\n    Do this\n```\n\nJust remember a for loop is generally used to run a piece of code each time for each occurrence of something.\n\nA while loop runs the same piece of code each time until a condition is met.\n\nObviously there are exceptions for both, but just starting out, it's a good way to view them. \n\nSo if you wanted to print hello ten times a while loop would be better. However, if you wanted to print each element in a list, a for loop would be the better option.",
            "Nothing you said is too concerning.  You should at points struggle with course work (you're learning it for the first time).  The key is to keep trying to understand it and be persistent.  \n\nTry learning it from a different source and medium.  By source don't just rely on your class textbook, try a different book (they may just explain it using a phrase that makes it all click for you).  By medium I mean if you've mostly used a textbook try watching a video on loops, or get a friend to explain it to you (or reddit).  These other mediums can trigger different parts of your brain to help it click.\n\nGood luck",
            "Don't quit because something is not immediately intuitive. \n\nAssuming you know that you want to become a computer programmer (which I think is a good idea), soak your brain in loops for a few weeks. \n\nThis means at least one hour of work understanding that subject every day, and more on the weekends. After a few weeks, let it stew for a week or so before revisiting it. This will allow your unconscious mind to digest the information.\n\nThere are many other strategies for learning! One of the most important is to determine your \"learning style\", then make sure you are using that to your advantage.",
            "Try to use a debugger to be able to visualize the state of the variable in the current scope. For instance :\n```\nx = 3\nfor i in range(10):\n    print(x)\n```\nIt's like saying print x 10 times\n\nWhat is also nice to know is that i is actually a variable (something that changes) that will contain 0,1,...,8,9\nIn computer science, we start at 0 =)\nSo if you were to do:\n```\nfor i in range(10):\n    print(i)\n```\nYou would get:\n0\n1\n2\n3\n.\n.\n.\n9\n\nNow what we call a for each in other programming language is when you iterate over all the element of a sequence (a list of element)\n```\nmy_list = [\"a\", \"g\", \"j\"]\nfor i in my_list:\n    print(i)\n```\nWill print :\na\ng\nj\n\nHope you'll understand better =)",

Each square represents the frequencies in which a player would raise (red) or call (black). Its tedious inputting the ranges into another program that takes in mouse clicks with a scroll wheel to change the frequency or you can enter the text. Like so:\n\n [https://imgur.com/a/2cyESQb](https://imgur.com/a/2cyESQb)\n\nAA-JJ,AKs,KQs,QJs,AKo,\\[90.0\\]AQs-AJs\\[/90.0\\],\\[75.0\\]TT-88\\[/75.0\\],\\[50.0\\]AQo,KQo\\[/50.0\\]\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo as you can see there are multiple problems I am having.\n\n1. Accurately reading the percentages of each square. The screenshots are about 600x600 and not every pixel is crisp so its difficult to code logic to say which pixel is red, black or grey.\n2. There needs to be some cleaning since ALL hands that are a specific frequency percentage need to be grouped together in between \\[xx.0\\] <hands, hands,>\\[/xx.0\\]. So I can't just go through a for loop with the associated hands and link the frequencies with the hand, I need another pass to get it organized into the specified format.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf anyone could help with discerning between rgb values of a low quality screenshot I'd be very grateful. Right now I'm taking the length of the image, dividing it by 13, taking the floor of that then looping through one square to take the ratio between rgb values in the pixel before it and if its close to 1 += a color count if not divide it by the length/13 (handsquarewidth) and adding it to a frequency dictionary. \n\nThe intermediary area sometimes is 3 or 4 pixels wide so it cuts down on the total frequency so i end up with for the AJs square  \\[0.425, 0.0, 0.525\\]. 42.5% raise, 0.0% due to the gradient area, and 52.5% call. Which doesn't look right because im doing 40 pixels for the hand square width which may not begin at the very start of the square and the gradient area cuts out some percents. It looks more like 35/65 to me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAny advice is welcomed.",

So you might as well use it for your scripting too, and not have to learn two things.\n\nOnce you have your feet wet, I would consider trying PyCharm (I use IntelliJ at work) because it can do a lot of cool stuff for you\u2014but it's really useful for _application development_, and if you're just scripting it will be massive overkill and you will either be paying for something you don't need or use (either monetarily or just memory overhead) or you'll be spending all day playing with the cool buttons rather than learning to program.",

            "Conda is a sort of superset of PIP.  It handles dependencies outside of Python, which are necessary for some ML libraries, and manages the virtualenv.  Anaconda is a distribution of many commonly used packages which is easier to setup for those who aren\u2019t as technically inclined. I\u2019d recommend using conda for packaging any sort of ML related project.",
            "Installing scientific packages on Python used to be a pain, especially on non-Linux systems. Ananconda made it a lot easier. These days it's not really an issue.",
            "If you're doing web development or something, pip is fine.   If you're doing complex machine learning, the fact that Anaconda handles all dependency management and ensures compatibility among all the hundreds of packages in its distribution is a godsend.  Could you spend hours pip installing all that stuff yourself?   Sure.    But why?",
            "To add to what others have said, building numpy with MKL bindings on your own is an exercise in frustration. Conda just ships them together.\n\nI've also had much better experience running CI for compiled components on different operating systems through Conda instead of standard CPython.",
            "I remember having a horrible time installing the usual data analysis packages under Windows, until finding out it Just Worked with Anaconda.",
            "For a lot of people a dependable version and distribution matter. Some of us work on remote machines with managed software stacks that have no internet access. Anaconda gives you a whole distribution so you already know what is there from python version to package versions. This is good for users because you don't need to get a bunch of different versions of stuff manually. You can just use the anaconda distribution.",
            "Python 2 and the rapid development of python 3 is a significant factor driving anaconda usage.\n\nIf you can't trust the system python to be up to date enough to be able to install the other libraries you need from pip, then you are forced to build python from source.\n\nHaving to build python from source was the leading cause of suicides, and the national suicide prevention hotline created anaconda as a response.",
            "Other people all have good points. One that I want to add -- Conda is actually a package manager not only for Python, but also for C/C++, R, Ruby, Lua, ect.  Unlike pip, a lot of the packages installed in Conda are straight up binaries rather than python files. So heavy loading processes such as ML and data processing might run faster in Conda packages compared to Python packages.",
            "Some years ago, conda was the solution to the dependency problems people started to have in the science community. Say you have an old big python program that is not well maintained but used by some people, and that breaks with newer libraries. How do you run this thing without breaking the other newer scripts on the server?\n\nOr some data scientist shares a Jupiter notebook on the web that doesn\u2019t work for you because of some incompatible library. Easy to solve if they share the conda environment file, too.",
            "I don't use Conda much at all, but when I do, I am generally impressed. If you need a solid tool to manage both dependencies and Python versions, it is a good option. Especially if you are into data science. Especially if all the packages you need are in [the conda repository](https://anaconda.org/anaconda/repo).\n\nI haven't felt the need for the whole Anaconda distribution. Just Conda seems worth a try.\n\n_Plenty_ of other options for virtual environment, project and dependency management. [I wrote a rundown recently](https://dev.to/bowmanjd/python-tools-for-managing-virtual-environments-3bko), and I am sure I didn't cover them all. Summary, if you don't feel like reading: use [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/), [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/), or Conda, depending on your interests and needs. Also, [Pyflow](https://github.com/David-OConnor/pyflow) is rather interesting.",
            "Because pip has a very poor dependency resolver, and because pip does not have the notion of dependency against compiled libraries outside the python ecosystem, something you care a lot to ensure you can deploy complex libraries without having them crash because you don't have libpng/mkl/vtk/whatnot",
            "The only reason i use anaconda is because when i tried to install python itself for some reason it did not work so i installed anaconda.",
            "I use pip. Pip is hope",
            "If you're on Linux, I wouldn't bother. Anaconda provides some benefit to Windows users, but it's a real pain to get it working. Our CI builds regularly fail due to conda issues, which is really annoying. It can be very slow to build and resolve a new environment, but some of the blame could be due to Windows (file locks, etc.).\n\nUsing conda on Linux though is just a world of pain for not much benefit. Stick with pip."

Ask to see an example of their \"best\" code AND an example of their \"worst\" code. If they refuse keep looking! If they say they have no bad code - they're lying. If they say yes ask to sit with one of their developers and walk thru a couple programs - ask the developer lots of questions -- by the end of an hour you'll know everything you need to know about the work environment and their values. This has saved me from hiring onto a death march more than once.",
            "I wouldn't call it \"Python fatigue\", it's more like a disease in the whole industry (not just software engineering, I'd say it affects every tech company). At home I have the newest hardware (well, not the newest, but usually not older than 2-5 years), most recent software (Archlinux, Fedora, yay), and can use whatever library I want, whatever coding style I want. I can write unit tests, I can run Gitlab instances with CI/CD, and so on.\n\nBut at work \u2026 I mean we still have machines running MS-DOS. We're using 2GB IDE disks and norton commander for making backups on those machines.\n\nA lot of people also don't understand that you can't write an app once and it will run forever. Software engineering, like mechanical and electrical engineering, requires maintenance. There are companies that understand that, and there are companies that don't. Try to find one that understands it.\n\nMy tl;dr is that many companies are currently in the process of changing and accepting that software engineering is not a one time thing. And if you want to improve code quality you absolutely need unit tests, and you need someone who maintains the code. And also, that they need to risk breaking a few things because the tests weren't good enough. Trying to deliver better software is \u2013 in my books \u2013 still better than not touching old code because we could break something.\n\nSo \u2026 yeah. I'm not sure if that helps you, just my point of view.",
            "My experience is that you'll see much the same thing in large enterprise codebases, to a greater or lesser extent, irrespective of which language you're working in. Certainly, the worst things I've seen in Java codebases are worse than the worst things I've seen in Python codebases.\n\nIt's also my experience that large enterprise-y open source projects are about as bad as large enterprise-y internal projects. For example, I've previously attempted to fix issues with Cobbler and Ansible, and (at the risk of causing controversy), found that both are at least as messed up as the internal project I was working on that used them. There's a certain amount of \"this project is my CV\" than motivates maintainers to keep smaller projects sane, but once a project becomes a product, it's subject to the same pointy-haired-boss nonsense as internal projects.\n\nSome languages have a bit less of this, mostly by virtue of being \"a bit weird\" (I'm thinking things like Erlang or Clojure), so only relatively confident developers would use them. But as soon as you've got a project that uses these languages in an organisation with bad hiring practices, you end up with a worse mess than you'd get if you'd used something boring like Java, as developers who don't know the language try and write code in it anyway - Ruby kinda went this way, when it want from being \"a hidden gem\", to \"hip\", to \"something people who look at Gartner quadrants want to try\", to \"the new PHP\".\n\nAll that said, if the problem is (say) that you've got a bunch of mediocre C# developers who are forced to write Python, and are insisting on writing C#-ish Python, maybe the answer is to just use C#. It's the path of least resistance, and I mention C# as it's a language that works well for mixed-ability teams.",

A good technical leader should protect and promote efforts to improve code quality and to adopt best practices. The leader should allocate time for internal work that can be improve productivity in longer term, like refactorings or training. \n\nIf you can't improve your leaders (e.g. by being promoted to be one), then it is time find a better company.",

            "Sounds like we work at the same company. Unfortunately, this seems to be a wide spread issue throughout the industry. You can either find another job where these code standards are valued, or you can try to push them harder on you current team. Maybe have a discussion with management? Unfortunately it seems quickly delivered \"working\" code will always be valued over more meticulous and slightly more time consuming code that is actually readable and standardized.",
            "A few of these things I can sympathize with your team on. I hate running flake8 and being told 400 times that my lines are 10 characters too long - that's not a problem with me, that's a problem with flake8. buried in the noise are a lot of \"variables defined and not used\" which is where all the real bugs are. if 5 times out of 10 it flagged what was basically a bug i'd feel better about it.\n\nI also look at some of these and see problems but not necessarily *big* problems - I don't like import * either but in every code base I've worked on where we've had it it's been the least of our problems so I wouldn't necessarily push it too hard (e.g. wouldnt' necessarily reject an otherwise decent pull request, although i'd comment). I never have it in my open source, but I kind of have to tolerate it and other things like it in commercial code otherwise a lot of production code would just never get deployed.\n\nI don't think you can apply the same rules in open source to commercial code. You're under different pressures and different constraints.\n\nThis isn't to say that code quality doesn't matter but I tend to find that you have to deal with it by identifying 10 problems and figuring out which is the biggest one for *all* of you and fix that rather than having a checklist of guidelines which you can mandate everybody follows or \"code doesn't get merged\". quality gates don't work when people aren't bought into them.\n\nIf they're rejecting the idea of making small changes where it's easy to understand the benefit, that's potentially a different story. i suspect they may be unconvinced of the benefit of many of these things though (& it will take some 'splainin to get them to see the light).",

            "Not enough info to really answer the question.\n\nDo you use features of newer python versions? Does the developer team have the bandwidth to handle whatever work is involved in supporting older versions? \n\nIt comes down to balancing available resources vs resource cost to continue support.\n\nI can easily imagine two different libraries where the answer to the question about supporting older python versions is different because different projects have different amounts of available resources and different amounts of required resources to support older python versions.",
            "HEll YEAH it is.",
            "There isn't a single concept of \"dropping support\", there are many different ways you can execute a sunset policy:\n\n1. You can hard-drop support and start deliberately using new features everywhere and drop all compatibility shims so that won't work in older versions, reject any patches that restores support for older versions.\n\n2. You can drop explicit support for older versions, but keep a \"best-effort\" policy to merge patches that restore support if people made a PR that backports the library to older syntaxes\n\n3. You can drop explicit support for older versions, but don't actually try to actively break older versions, they just don't get tested and it'll only break when someday someone will submit a patch that breaks the older version.\n\n4. You can make a separate maintenance fork for the older versions, they won't get all the new features but if people make PRs on those branch to backport fixes or other features, they're welcome to do so and they will get merged like any others\n\nThere are infinitely many in the spectrum of sunset policy, but ultimately it's the maintainer's decision on what they are willing to spend time supporting on. If the maintainer works in company that uses the library for a mission critical software that still uses Python 2.7, they'd be unlikely to accept dropping support for it as long as that mission critical software is still running on the old version.\n\nIn any case, consider that people who don't upgrade their Python version probably are also fine not getting the latest updates from your library. If they're interested in bleeding edge, they'd have upgraded to Python 3 as well a long time ago.\n\nIf you're not the core maintainer of a project, you won't be making these decisions for them. They're the one that decides what they want to support. If they tell you your PR need to run on 2.7, you make sure they do if you're interested in getting it merged to the project. \n\nIf you're not happy with that situation, you can maintain your own fork, modernize the codebase in your own fork, and publish your own package; pretty much all FLOSS license allows you to do so. If you get enough people interested enough in the changes you're making, the crowd might start shifting to your fork and the two projects can live happily apart. Forked projects that becomes more popular than the original projects are relatively rare, but it happens from time to time.",

            "While learning/studying it's normal for something to not be intuitive. If everything is directly clear to you then is the study really worth the time? The study is supposed to learn you something, and if you're struggling to understand something but eventually do, it's learning you something.\n\nAlso, what is it that is causing you trouble with loops, maybe I(we on reddit) can help you if we know that?",
            "    my_items = [1, 2, 3]\n    for x in my_items:\n        print(x)\n\nLet's use a simple example. When a loop runs, you are \"iterating\" through each item in the list. The item is assigned to the variable x in the above example. The indented code is then executed. Once we get to the end of the block, the flow goes back to the \"for\" statement. The second value in the list is assigned to x and we execute the indented block of code. This repeats until we run out of items in the list. The flow then continues on with whatever code comes after. \n\nYou could manually write out the above loop, which would be\n\n    x = 1\n    print(x)\n    x = 2\n    print(x)\n    x = 3\n    print(x)\n\nBoth of these code examples will produce the same output. However, the second requires very explicit commands. What if you want a longer set of values, or different values? With the for loop, you can simply provide a new value for my_items and the loop will print each value in the list.",
            "What exactly are you having trouble with?",
            "The best thing that ever helped me out with loops was sounding my loops out in my head as sentences. Python is really great to start that with because it is a coding language that is very close to the English language and how we structure words and sentences. (At least that's how I feel). However, I have taken this approach even in other languages I have learned.\n\nAn example:\n\nSay you have a list and you wanna loop that list, your code might look like so...\n\n```\nmyList = [\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"]\n\nfor letter in myList:\n    do something\n```\n\nHowever, it might make more sense to structure it like a sentence as you write it out.\n\nFor example the above example would be like so:\n\n```\nFor each letter in myList:\n    Do this\n```\n\nJust remember a for loop is generally used to run a piece of code each time for each occurrence of something.\n\nA while loop runs the same piece of code each time until a condition is met.\n\nObviously there are exceptions for both, but just starting out, it's a good way to view them. \n\nSo if you wanted to print hello ten times a while loop would be better. However, if you wanted to print each element in a list, a for loop would be the better option.",
            "Nothing you said is too concerning.  You should at points struggle with course work (you're learning it for the first time).  The key is to keep trying to understand it and be persistent.  \n\nTry learning it from a different source and medium.  By source don't just rely on your class textbook, try a different book (they may just explain it using a phrase that makes it all click for you).  By medium I mean if you've mostly used a textbook try watching a video on loops, or get a friend to explain it to you (or reddit).  These other mediums can trigger different parts of your brain to help it click.\n\nGood luck",
            "Don't quit because something is not immediately intuitive. \n\nAssuming you know that you want to become a computer programmer (which I think is a good idea), soak your brain in loops for a few weeks. \n\nThis means at least one hour of work understanding that subject every day, and more on the weekends. After a few weeks, let it stew for a week or so before revisiting it. This will allow your unconscious mind to digest the information.\n\nThere are many other strategies for learning! One of the most important is to determine your \"learning style\", then make sure you are using that to your advantage.",
            "Try to use a debugger to be able to visualize the state of the variable in the current scope. For instance :\n```\nx = 3\nfor i in range(10):\n    print(x)\n```\nIt's like saying print x 10 times\n\nWhat is also nice to know is that i is actually a variable (something that changes) that will contain 0,1,...,8,9\nIn computer science, we start at 0 =)\nSo if you were to do:\n```\nfor i in range(10):\n    print(i)\n```\nYou would get:\n0\n1\n2\n3\n.\n.\n.\n9\n\nNow what we call a for each in other programming language is when you iterate over all the element of a sequence (a list of element)\n```\nmy_list = [\"a\", \"g\", \"j\"]\nfor i in my_list:\n    print(i)\n```\nWill print :\na\ng\nj\n\nHope you'll understand better =)",

Each square represents the frequencies in which a player would raise (red) or call (black). Its tedious inputting the ranges into another program that takes in mouse clicks with a scroll wheel to change the frequency or you can enter the text. Like so:\n\n [https://imgur.com/a/2cyESQb](https://imgur.com/a/2cyESQb)\n\nAA-JJ,AKs,KQs,QJs,AKo,\\[90.0\\]AQs-AJs\\[/90.0\\],\\[75.0\\]TT-88\\[/75.0\\],\\[50.0\\]AQo,KQo\\[/50.0\\]\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo as you can see there are multiple problems I am having.\n\n1. Accurately reading the percentages of each square. The screenshots are about 600x600 and not every pixel is crisp so its difficult to code logic to say which pixel is red, black or grey.\n2. There needs to be some cleaning since ALL hands that are a specific frequency percentage need to be grouped together in between \\[xx.0\\] <hands, hands,>\\[/xx.0\\]. So I can't just go through a for loop with the associated hands and link the frequencies with the hand, I need another pass to get it organized into the specified format.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf anyone could help with discerning between rgb values of a low quality screenshot I'd be very grateful. Right now I'm taking the length of the image, dividing it by 13, taking the floor of that then looping through one square to take the ratio between rgb values in the pixel before it and if its close to 1 += a color count if not divide it by the length/13 (handsquarewidth) and adding it to a frequency dictionary. \n\nThe intermediary area sometimes is 3 or 4 pixels wide so it cuts down on the total frequency so i end up with for the AJs square  \\[0.425, 0.0, 0.525\\]. 42.5% raise, 0.0% due to the gradient area, and 52.5% call. Which doesn't look right because im doing 40 pixels for the hand square width which may not begin at the very start of the square and the gradient area cuts out some percents. It looks more like 35/65 to me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAny advice is welcomed.",

This week I hope to finish up the dynamic unloading/reloading of users automation code and have a working MQTT handler (although not a complete one, but enough for simple events).

            "Very good project. Thanks for making it open source too!",
            "This is just massive im so happy for u for completing such a huge project",
            "I tried shading boxes. Nothing happened. Then when I refreshed the boxes I had tried to shade disappeared. Using Firefox 81.0 with Windows 10.\n\nThe interface confused me. Having to select a number and click \"Shade\" seems odd to me. I wanted to select a color and then click a number, and have that shade applied to that number. Maybe a shade mode and a text mode, to do different things on clicking a number? Maybe an easy way to change the shade in the text editing box?\n\nCool project.",
            "This looks awesome, great job!",
            "\"You can:\n\nShade 'boxes' of your life and give them meanings\"\n\nWhat if you said you can colour code boxes? Perhaps you can highlight boxes. Otherwise you label boxes using colour.\n\nAll of the above seem preferable to shading boxes. Perhaps that's semantic detail that's seemingly unimportant to you, but those are the only criticisms I have. Otherwise your project appears to be amazing when taken at face value.",
            "Nice! Maybe it's just me, but I find the enumeration of years and highlighting of the \"present\" to be counter-intuitive and maybe wrong? I'm 29, but \"year 28\" is highlighted yellow on the year view. Shouldn't \"year 30\" be highlighted yellow since I'm in the 30th year of my life? When I was just born, that was year 1 of my life. At 53 weeks old, I was in year 2. Etc.\n\nThoughts?",
            "Amazing website man :D   \nI was snooping through your JS, looks lovely <3",
            "Nice, but doesn't work for me atm. There are no years or months being shown. (It worked for a few minutes,  than they vanished)\n\nIt would be cool if I could click on a year, and then see it's months so I can add some events from my past. Finding just the right month by its absolute number looks a little bit complicated.\n\nHow do plan to stay online \"forever\"? I mean it's a great concept, but I wouldn't like to enter much detail into it and it a few years the website goes offline. Would be shame, you know",
            "Really cool idea! I would love to have a swim lane view of that, where I can keep memories of events, vacations etc. this would let me document my life and give me an overview of what I have done and a planner of what I will do at the same time.\nIf you want you can make life stories sharable with friends. Where you can co-author events together which would make it into a facebook like application but much more personal and less annoying.",
            "Real fucking cool man holy shit! Motivated me to go work on some project ideas that have been collecting cobwebs lol..",
            "This is so cool, great job and great idea for a project! I'm also learning Python to build a project of this level, so maybe I'll use yours to plan out my deadline :)",
            "Dude this is fucking awesome. The perfect thing for someone who loves planning and data! This is going to help me so much with holding myself accountable for my goals. Thank you, man. Only thing I'm worried about is if it gets taken down sometime in the future and I lose all of my planning!",

            "I'd suggest vim. It's available pretty much everywhere, and it's probably already installed in most servers you're targeting too, and you can use it over ssh. So it's good to be familiar editing with editing text from the shell-based text editor rather than getting used to IDEs that you can't use when doing pentest.\n\nYou probably can't or won't be bringing your own fully decked out vimrc when shelling into some servers (and I do recommend getting things setup nicely for your local environment), but you can go a very long way even with just vim at default settings without any plugins.",

Try something like Ubuntu of Debian instead.",
            "I would advice using Anaconda rather than pure Python. I started with pure python but anaconda makes it much easier.\n\nAnaconda comes with several IDEs. I like spyder and Jupiter. \n\nFor a beginner, I would recommend Jupiter notebooks because it is easier to learn syntax etc with it. When you are actually programming, you can go to a different IDE.to program",
            "Since you're just getting started, I would stick to something very simple. Since you're doing security, I would consider using vim (I hate typing this, as an emacs guy) but vi will be there on every system you ever need to access and works great remote. So you might as well use it for your scripting too, and not have to learn two things.\n\nOnce you have your feet wet, I would consider trying PyCharm (I use IntelliJ at work) because it can do a lot of cool stuff for you\u2014but it's really useful for _application development_, and if you're just scripting it will be massive overkill and you will either be paying for something you don't need or use (either monetarily or just memory overhead) or you'll be spending all day playing with the cool buttons rather than learning to program.",

            "Also, I was curious if you guys had an opinion on the best distro for programming? I have Kali VMs on both my desktop and laptop and I have RPi OS on my RPi4. But I was wondering if there was a better distro suited for programming (or whatever your personal preference is).\n\nMuch Appreciated.",

            "Conda is a sort of superset of PIP.  It handles dependencies outside of Python, which are necessary for some ML libraries, and manages the virtualenv.  Anaconda is a distribution of many commonly used packages which is easier to setup for those who aren\u2019t as technically inclined. I\u2019d recommend using conda for packaging any sort of ML related project.",
            "Installing scientific packages on Python used to be a pain, especially on non-Linux systems. Ananconda made it a lot easier. These days it's not really an issue.",
            "If you're doing web development or something, pip is fine.   If you're doing complex machine learning, the fact that Anaconda handles all dependency management and ensures compatibility among all the hundreds of packages in its distribution is a godsend.  Could you spend hours pip installing all that stuff yourself?   Sure.    But why?",
            "To add to what others have said, building numpy with MKL bindings on your own is an exercise in frustration. Conda just ships them together.\n\nI've also had much better experience running CI for compiled components on different operating systems through Conda instead of standard CPython.",
            "I remember having a horrible time installing the usual data analysis packages under Windows, until finding out it Just Worked with Anaconda.",
            "For a lot of people a dependable version and distribution matter. Some of us work on remote machines with managed software stacks that have no internet access. Anaconda gives you a whole distribution so you already know what is there from python version to package versions. This is good for users because you don't need to get a bunch of different versions of stuff manually. You can just use the anaconda distribution.",
            "Python 2 and the rapid development of python 3 is a significant factor driving anaconda usage.\n\nIf you can't trust the system python to be up to date enough to be able to install the other libraries you need from pip, then you are forced to build python from source.\n\nHaving to build python from source was the leading cause of suicides, and the national suicide prevention hotline created anaconda as a response.",
            "Other people all have good points. One that I want to add -- Conda is actually a package manager not only for Python, but also for C/C++, R, Ruby, Lua, ect.  Unlike pip, a lot of the packages installed in Conda are straight up binaries rather than python files. So heavy loading processes such as ML and data processing might run faster in Conda packages compared to Python packages.",
            "Some years ago, conda was the solution to the dependency problems people started to have in the science community. Say you have an old big python program that is not well maintained but used by some people, and that breaks with newer libraries. How do you run this thing without breaking the other newer scripts on the server?\n\nOr some data scientist shares a Jupiter notebook on the web that doesn\u2019t work for you because of some incompatible library. Easy to solve if they share the conda environment file, too.",
            "I don't use Conda much at all, but when I do, I am generally impressed. If you need a solid tool to manage both dependencies and Python versions, it is a good option. Especially if you are into data science. Especially if all the packages you need are in [the conda repository](https://anaconda.org/anaconda/repo).\n\nI haven't felt the need for the whole Anaconda distribution. Just Conda seems worth a try.\n\n_Plenty_ of other options for virtual environment, project and dependency management. [I wrote a rundown recently](https://dev.to/bowmanjd/python-tools-for-managing-virtual-environments-3bko), and I am sure I didn't cover them all. Summary, if you don't feel like reading: use [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/), [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/), or Conda, depending on your interests and needs. Also, [Pyflow](https://github.com/David-OConnor/pyflow) is rather interesting.",
            "Because pip has a very poor dependency resolver, and because pip does not have the notion of dependency against compiled libraries outside the python ecosystem, something you care a lot to ensure you can deploy complex libraries without having them crash because you don't have libpng/mkl/vtk/whatnot",

            "I use pip. Pip is hope",
            "If you're on Linux, I wouldn't bother. Anaconda provides some benefit to Windows users, but it's a real pain to get it working. Our CI builds regularly fail due to conda issues, which is really annoying. It can be very slow to build and resolve a new environment, but some of the blame could be due to Windows (file locks, etc.).\n\nUsing conda on Linux though is just a world of pain for not much benefit. Stick with pip."

Ask to see an example of their \"best\" code AND an example of their \"worst\" code. If they refuse keep looking! If they say they have no bad code - they're lying. If they say yes ask to sit with one of their developers and walk thru a couple programs - ask the developer lots of questions -- by the end of an hour you'll know everything you need to know about the work environment and their values. This has saved me from hiring onto a death march more than once.",
            "I wouldn't call it \"Python fatigue\", it's more like a disease in the whole industry (not just software engineering, I'd say it affects every tech company). At home I have the newest hardware (well, not the newest, but usually not older than 2-5 years), most recent software (Archlinux, Fedora, yay), and can use whatever library I want, whatever coding style I want. I can write unit tests, I can run Gitlab instances with CI/CD, and so on.\n\nBut at work \u2026 I mean we still have machines running MS-DOS. We're using 2GB IDE disks and norton commander for making backups on those machines.\n\nA lot of people also don't understand that you can't write an app once and it will run forever. Software engineering, like mechanical and electrical engineering, requires maintenance. There are companies that understand that, and there are companies that don't. Try to find one that understands it.\n\nMy tl;dr is that many companies are currently in the process of changing and accepting that software engineering is not a one time thing. And if you want to improve code quality you absolutely need unit tests, and you need someone who maintains the code. And also, that they need to risk breaking a few things because the tests weren't good enough. Trying to deliver better software is \u2013 in my books \u2013 still better than not touching old code because we could break something.\n\nSo \u2026 yeah.

            "My experience is that you'll see much the same thing in large enterprise codebases, to a greater or lesser extent, irrespective of which language you're working in. Certainly, the worst things I've seen in Java codebases are worse than the worst things I've seen in Python codebases.\n\nIt's also my experience that large enterprise-y open source projects are about as bad as large enterprise-y internal projects. For example, I've previously attempted to fix issues with Cobbler and Ansible, and (at the risk of causing controversy), found that both are at least as messed up as the internal project I was working on that used them. There's a certain amount of \"this project is my CV\" than motivates maintainers to keep smaller projects sane, but once a project becomes a product, it's subject to the same pointy-haired-boss nonsense as internal projects.\n\nSome languages have a bit less of this, mostly by virtue of being \"a bit weird\" (I'm thinking things like Erlang or Clojure), so only relatively confident developers would use them. But as soon as you've got a project that uses these languages in an organisation with bad hiring practices, you end up with a worse mess than you'd get if you'd used something boring like Java, as developers who don't know the language try and write code in it anyway - Ruby kinda went this way, when it want from being \"a hidden gem\", to \"hip\", to \"something people who look at Gartner quadrants want to try\", to \"the new PHP\".\n\nAll that said, if the problem is (say) that you've got a bunch of mediocre C# developers who are forced to write Python, and are insisting on writing C#-ish Python, maybe the answer is to just use C#. It's the path of least resistance, and I mention C# as it's a language that works well for mixed-ability teams.",

A good technical leader should protect and promote efforts to improve code quality and to adopt best practices.

Worked pretty well.\n\nNothing to do with language;all to do with culture and leadership.",

Thankfully I've found a job where my teammates share my opinion on how to write maintainable and clean code. I count myself VERY lucky.

You can either find another job where these code standards are valued, or you can try to push them harder on you current team. Maybe have a discussion with management?

            "A few of these things I can sympathize with your team on. I hate running flake8 and being told 400 times that my lines are 10 characters too long - that's not a problem with me, that's a problem with flake8. buried in the noise are a lot of \"variables defined and not used\" which is where all the real bugs are. if 5 times out of 10 it flagged what was basically a bug i'd feel better about it.\n\nI also look at some of these and see problems but not necessarily *big* problems - I don't like import * either but in every code base I've worked on where we've had it it's been the least of our problems so I wouldn't necessarily push it too hard (e.g. wouldnt' necessarily reject an otherwise decent pull request, although i'd comment). I never have it in my open source, but I kind of have to tolerate it and other things like it in commercial code otherwise a lot of production code would just never get deployed.\n\nI don't think you can apply the same rules in open source to commercial code. You're under different pressures and different constraints.\n\nThis isn't to say that code quality doesn't matter but I tend to find that you have to deal with it by identifying 10 problems and figuring out which is the biggest one for *all* of you and fix that rather than having a checklist of guidelines which you can mandate everybody follows or \"code doesn't get merged\". quality gates don't work when people aren't bought into them.\n\nIf they're rejecting the idea of making small changes where it's easy to understand the benefit, that's potentially a different story. i suspect they may be unconvinced of the benefit of many of these things though (& it will take some 'splainin to get them to see the light).",

Other things to do than just software development? The sad truth behind a lot of these problems is if you don't establish good behaviors as a baseline you can never get people to change.

            "It's better for everyone to move on, and whomever made the choice for the library would be either dragging people screaming and kicking into the new version, or leave a lot of outdated, and vulnerable code out there.\n\nBreak the code in same way to force people onto the new version or they'll be stupid and go with the last stable version and pray.\n\nI don't envy your position, but good luck.",
            "Not enough info to really answer the question.\n\nDo you use features of newer python versions? Does the developer team have the bandwidth to handle whatever work is involved in supporting older versions? \n\nIt comes down to balancing available resources vs resource cost to continue support.\n\nI can easily imagine two different libraries where the answer to the question about supporting older python versions is different because different projects have different amounts of available resources and different amounts of required resources to support older python versions.",
            "HEll YEAH it is.",
            "There isn't a single concept of \"dropping support\", there are many different ways you can execute a sunset policy:\n\n1. You can hard-drop support and start deliberately using new features everywhere and drop all compatibility shims so that won't work in older versions, reject any patches that restores support for older versions.\n\n2. You can drop explicit support for older versions, but keep a \"best-effort\" policy to merge patches that restore support if people made a PR that backports the library to older syntaxes\n\n3. You can drop explicit support for older versions, but don't actually try to actively break older versions, they just don't get tested and it'll only break when someday someone will submit a patch that breaks the older version.\n\n4. You can make a separate maintenance fork for the older versions, they won't get all the new features but if people make PRs on those branch to backport fixes or other features, they're welcome to do so and they will get merged like any others\n\nThere are infinitely many in the spectrum of sunset policy, but ultimately it's the maintainer's decision on what they are willing to spend time supporting on. If the maintainer works in company that uses the library for a mission critical software that still uses Python 2.7, they'd be unlikely to accept dropping support for it as long as that mission critical software is still running on the old version.\n\nIn any case, consider that people who don't upgrade their Python version probably are also fine not getting the latest updates from your library. If they're interested in bleeding edge, they'd have upgraded to Python 3 as well a long time ago.\n\nIf you're not the core maintainer of a project, you won't be making these decisions for them. They're the one that decides what they want to support. If they tell you your PR need to run on 2.7, you make sure they do if you're interested in getting it merged to the project. \n\nIf you're not happy with that situation, you can maintain your own fork, modernize the codebase in your own fork, and publish your own package; pretty much all FLOSS license allows you to do so. If you get enough people interested enough in the changes you're making, the crowd might start shifting to your fork and the two projects can live happily apart. Forked projects that becomes more popular than the original projects are relatively rare, but it happens from time to time.",

            "While learning/studying it's normal for something to not be intuitive. If everything is directly clear to you then is the study really worth the time? The study is supposed to learn you something, and if you're struggling to understand something but eventually do, it's learning you something.\n\nAlso, what is it that is causing you trouble with loops, maybe I(we on reddit) can help you if we know that?",
            "    my_items = [1, 2, 3]\n    for x in my_items:\n        print(x)\n\nLet's use a simple example. When a loop runs, you are \"iterating\" through each item in the list. The item is assigned to the variable x in the above example. The indented code is then executed. Once we get to the end of the block, the flow goes back to the \"for\" statement. The second value in the list is assigned to x and we execute the indented block of code. This repeats until we run out of items in the list. The flow then continues on with whatever code comes after. \n\nYou could manually write out the above loop, which would be\n\n    x = 1\n    print(x)\n    x = 2\n    print(x)\n    x = 3\n    print(x)\n\nBoth of these code examples will produce the same output. However, the second requires very explicit commands. What if you want a longer set of values, or different values? With the for loop, you can simply provide a new value for my_items and the loop will print each value in the list.",
            "What exactly are you having trouble with?",
            "The best thing that ever helped me out with loops was sounding my loops out in my head as sentences. Python is really great to start that with because it is a coding language that is very close to the English language and how we structure words and sentences. (At least that's how I feel). However, I have taken this approach even in other languages I have learned.\n\nAn example:\n\nSay you have a list and you wanna loop that list, your code might look like so...\n\n```\nmyList = [\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"]\n\nfor letter in myList:\n    do something\n```\n\nHowever, it might make more sense to structure it like a sentence as you write it out.\n\nFor example the above example would be like so:\n\n```\nFor each letter in myList:\n    Do this\n```\n\nJust remember a for loop is generally used to run a piece of code each time for each occurrence of something.\n\nA while loop runs the same piece of code each time until a condition is met.\n\nObviously there are exceptions for both, but just starting out, it's a good way to view them. \n\nSo if you wanted to print hello ten times a while loop would be better. However, if you wanted to print each element in a list, a for loop would be the better option.",
            "Nothing you said is too concerning.  You should at points struggle with course work (you're learning it for the first time).  The key is to keep trying to understand it and be persistent.  \n\nTry learning it from a different source and medium.  By source don't just rely on your class textbook, try a different book (they may just explain it using a phrase that makes it all click for you).  By medium I mean if you've mostly used a textbook try watching a video on loops, or get a friend to explain it to you (or reddit).  These other mediums can trigger different parts of your brain to help it click.\n\nGood luck",
            "Don't quit because something is not immediately intuitive. \n\nAssuming you know that you want to become a computer programmer (which I think is a good idea), soak your brain in loops for a few weeks. \n\nThis means at least one hour of work understanding that subject every day, and more on the weekends. After a few weeks, let it stew for a week or so before revisiting it. This will allow your unconscious mind to digest the information.\n\nThere are many other strategies for learning! One of the most important is to determine your \"learning style\", then make sure you are using that to your advantage.",
            "Try to use a debugger to be able to visualize the state of the variable in the current scope. For instance :\n```\nx = 3\nfor i in range(10):\n    print(x)\n```\nIt's like saying print x 10 times\n\nWhat is also nice to know is that i is actually a variable (something that changes) that will contain 0,1,...,8,9\nIn computer science, we start at 0 =)\nSo if you were to do:\n```\nfor i in range(10):\n    print(i)\n```\nYou would get:\n0\n1\n2\n3\n.\n.\n.\n9\n\nNow what we call a for each in other programming language is when you iterate over all the element of a sequence (a list of element)\n```\nmy_list = [\"a\", \"g\", \"j\"]\nfor i in my_list:\n    print(i)\n```\nWill print :\na\ng\nj\n\nHope you'll understand better =)",

Each square represents the frequencies in which a player would raise (red) or call (black). Its tedious inputting the ranges into another program that takes in mouse clicks with a scroll wheel to change the frequency or you can enter the text. Like so:\n\n [https://imgur.com/a/2cyESQb](https://imgur.com/a/2cyESQb)\n\nAA-JJ,AKs,KQs,QJs,AKo,\\[90.0\\]AQs-AJs\\[/90.0\\],\\[75.0\\]TT-88\\[/75.0\\],\\[50.0\\]AQo,KQo\\[/50.0\\]\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo as you can see there are multiple problems I am having.\n\n1. Accurately reading the percentages of each square. The screenshots are about 600x600 and not every pixel is crisp so its difficult to code logic to say which pixel is red, black or grey.\n2. There needs to be some cleaning since ALL hands that are a specific frequency percentage need to be grouped together in between \\[xx.0\\] <hands, hands,>\\[/xx.0\\]. So I can't just go through a for loop with the associated hands and link the frequencies with the hand, I need another pass to get it organized into the specified format.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf anyone could help with discerning between rgb values of a low quality screenshot I'd be very grateful. Right now I'm taking the length of the image, dividing it by 13, taking the floor of that then looping through one square to take the ratio between rgb values in the pixel before it and if its close to 1 += a color count if not divide it by the length/13 (handsquarewidth) and adding it to a frequency dictionary. \n\nThe intermediary area sometimes is 3 or 4 pixels wide so it cuts down on the total frequency so i end up with for the AJs square  \\[0.425, 0.0, 0.525\\]. 42.5% raise, 0.0% due to the gradient area, and 52.5% call. Which doesn't look right because im doing 40 pixels for the hand square width which may not begin at the very start of the square and the gradient area cuts out some percents. It looks more like 35/65 to me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAny advice is welcomed.",

So I am working on a python alternative where a user can write python and attach it to events that happen and the the back end server calls the handlers when needed and handles all the registering of events, calling handlers, logging, loading and reloading of modules (dynamically without restarting).  This week I hope to finish up the dynamic unloading/reloading of users automation code and have a working MQTT handler (although not a complete one, but enough for simple events).  The hard part with the reloading of user code is that I have to carefully track all callbacks registered (and which module they came from) and unregister them or the user's old code will still be called when events happen.\n\nThis is a rather big project, I plan to post it to github once their is more functionality; however, if this project interests others and they want to help work on it let me know.",

            "I tried shading boxes. Nothing happened. Then when I refreshed the boxes I had tried to shade disappeared. Using Firefox 81.0 with Windows 10.\n\nThe interface confused me. Having to select a number and click \"Shade\" seems odd to me. I wanted to select a color and then click a number, and have that shade applied to that number. Maybe a shade mode and a text mode, to do different things on clicking a number? Maybe an easy way to change the shade in the text editing box?\n\nCool project.",
            "This looks awesome, great job!",
            "\"You can:\n\nShade 'boxes' of your life and give them meanings\"\n\nWhat if you said you can colour code boxes? Perhaps you can highlight boxes. Otherwise you label boxes using colour.\n\nAll of the above seem preferable to shading boxes. Perhaps that's semantic detail that's seemingly unimportant to you, but those are the only criticisms I have. Otherwise your project appears to be amazing when taken at face value.",
            "Nice! Maybe it's just me, but I find the enumeration of years and highlighting of the \"present\" to be counter-intuitive and maybe wrong? I'm 29, but \"year 28\" is highlighted yellow on the year view. Shouldn't \"year 30\" be highlighted yellow since I'm in the 30th year of my life? When I was just born, that was year 1 of my life. At 53 weeks old, I was in year 2. Etc.\n\nThoughts?",

            "Nice, but doesn't work for me atm. There are no years or months being shown. (It worked for a few minutes,  than they vanished)\n\nIt would be cool if I could click on a year, and then see it's months so I can add some events from my past. Finding just the right month by its absolute number looks a little bit complicated.\n\nHow do plan to stay online \"forever\"? I mean it's a great concept, but I wouldn't like to enter much detail into it and it a few years the website goes offline. Would be shame, you know",
            "Really cool idea! I would love to have a swim lane view of that, where I can keep memories of events, vacations etc. this would let me document my life and give me an overview of what I have done and a planner of what I will do at the same time.\nIf you want you can make life stories sharable with friends. Where you can co-author events together which would make it into a facebook like application but much more personal and less annoying.",
            "Real fucking cool man holy shit! Motivated me to go work on some project ideas that have been collecting cobwebs lol..",
            "This is so cool, great job and great idea for a project! I'm also learning Python to build a project of this level, so maybe I'll use yours to plan out my deadline :)",
            "Dude this is fucking awesome. The perfect thing for someone who loves planning and data! This is going to help me so much with holding myself accountable for my goals. Thank you, man. Only thing I'm worried about is if it gets taken down sometime in the future and I lose all of my planning!",

So it's good to be familiar editing with editing text from the shell-based text editor rather than getting used to IDEs that you can't use when doing pentest.\n\nYou probably can't or won't be bringing your own fully decked out vimrc when shelling into some servers (and I do recommend getting things setup nicely for your local environment), but you can go a very long way even with just vim at default settings without any plugins.",

Try something like Ubuntu of Debian instead.",

I like spyder and Jupiter. \n\nFor a beginner, I would recommend Jupiter notebooks because it is easier to learn syntax etc with it. When you are actually programming, you can go to a different IDE.to program",
            "Since you're just getting started, I would stick to something very simple. Since you're doing security, I would consider using vim (I hate typing this, as an emacs guy) but vi will be there on every system you ever need to access and works great remote. So you might as well use it for your scripting too, and not have to learn two things.\n\nOnce you have your feet wet, I would consider trying PyCharm (I use IntelliJ at work) because it can do a lot of cool stuff for you\u2014but it's really useful for _application development_, and if you're just scripting it will be massive overkill and you will either be paying for something you don't need or use (either monetarily or just memory overhead) or you'll be spending all day playing with the cool buttons rather than learning to program.",

            "Conda is a sort of superset of PIP.  It handles dependencies outside of Python, which are necessary for some ML libraries, and manages the virtualenv.  Anaconda is a distribution of many commonly used packages which is easier to setup for those who aren\u2019t as technically inclined. I\u2019d recommend using conda for packaging any sort of ML related project.",
            "Installing scientific packages on Python used to be a pain, especially on non-Linux systems. Ananconda made it a lot easier. These days it's not really an issue.",
            "If you're doing web development or something, pip is fine.   If you're doing complex machine learning, the fact that Anaconda handles all dependency management and ensures compatibility among all the hundreds of packages in its distribution is a godsend.  Could you spend hours pip installing all that stuff yourself?   Sure.    But why?",
            "To add to what others have said, building numpy with MKL bindings on your own is an exercise in frustration. Conda just ships them together.\n\nI've also had much better experience running CI for compiled components on different operating systems through Conda instead of standard CPython.",
            "I remember having a horrible time installing the usual data analysis packages under Windows, until finding out it Just Worked with Anaconda.",
            "For a lot of people a dependable version and distribution matter. Some of us work on remote machines with managed software stacks that have no internet access. Anaconda gives you a whole distribution so you already know what is there from python version to package versions. This is good for users because you don't need to get a bunch of different versions of stuff manually. You can just use the anaconda distribution.",
            "Python 2 and the rapid development of python 3 is a significant factor driving anaconda usage.\n\nIf you can't trust the system python to be up to date enough to be able to install the other libraries you need from pip, then you are forced to build python from source.\n\nHaving to build python from source was the leading cause of suicides, and the national suicide prevention hotline created anaconda as a response.",
            "Other people all have good points. One that I want to add -- Conda is actually a package manager not only for Python, but also for C/C++, R, Ruby, Lua, ect.  Unlike pip, a lot of the packages installed in Conda are straight up binaries rather than python files. So heavy loading processes such as ML and data processing might run faster in Conda packages compared to Python packages.",
            "Some years ago, conda was the solution to the dependency problems people started to have in the science community. Say you have an old big python program that is not well maintained but used by some people, and that breaks with newer libraries. How do you run this thing without breaking the other newer scripts on the server?\n\nOr some data scientist shares a Jupiter notebook on the web that doesn\u2019t work for you because of some incompatible library. Easy to solve if they share the conda environment file, too.",
            "I don't use Conda much at all, but when I do, I am generally impressed. If you need a solid tool to manage both dependencies and Python versions, it is a good option. Especially if you are into data science. Especially if all the packages you need are in [the conda repository](https://anaconda.org/anaconda/repo).\n\nI haven't felt the need for the whole Anaconda distribution. Just Conda seems worth a try.\n\n_Plenty_ of other options for virtual environment, project and dependency management. [I wrote a rundown recently](https://dev.to/bowmanjd/python-tools-for-managing-virtual-environments-3bko), and I am sure I didn't cover them all. Summary, if you don't feel like reading: use [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/), [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/), or Conda, depending on your interests and needs. Also, [Pyflow](https://github.com/David-OConnor/pyflow) is rather interesting.",
            "Because pip has a very poor dependency resolver, and because pip does not have the notion of dependency against compiled libraries outside the python ecosystem, something you care a lot to ensure you can deploy complex libraries without having them crash because you don't have libpng/mkl/vtk/whatnot",
            "The only reason i use anaconda is because when i tried to install python itself for some reason it did not work so i installed anaconda.",
            "I use pip. Pip is hope",
            "If you're on Linux, I wouldn't bother. Anaconda provides some benefit to Windows users, but it's a real pain to get it working. Our CI builds regularly fail due to conda issues, which is really annoying. It can be very slow to build and resolve a new environment, but some of the blame could be due to Windows (file locks, etc.).\n\nUsing conda on Linux though is just a world of pain for not much benefit. Stick with pip."

Ask to see an example of their \"best\" code AND an example of their \"worst\" code. If they refuse keep looking! If they say they have no bad code - they're lying. If they say yes ask to sit with one of their developers and walk thru a couple programs - ask the developer lots of questions -- by the end of an hour you'll know everything you need to know about the work environment and their values. This has saved me from hiring onto a death march more than once.",
            "I wouldn't call it \"Python fatigue\", it's more like a disease in the whole industry (not just software engineering, I'd say it affects every tech company). At home I have the newest hardware (well, not the newest, but usually not older than 2-5 years), most recent software (Archlinux, Fedora, yay), and can use whatever library I want, whatever coding style I want. I can write unit tests, I can run Gitlab instances with CI/CD, and so on.\n\nBut at work \u2026 I mean we still have machines running MS-DOS. We're using 2GB IDE disks and norton commander for making backups on those machines.\n\nA lot of people also don't understand that you can't write an app once and it will run forever. Software engineering, like mechanical and electrical engineering, requires maintenance. There are companies that understand that, and there are companies that don't. Try to find one that understands it.\n\nMy tl;dr is that many companies are currently in the process of changing and accepting that software engineering is not a one time thing. And if you want to improve code quality you absolutely need unit tests, and you need someone who maintains the code. And also, that they need to risk breaking a few things because the tests weren't good enough. Trying to deliver better software is \u2013 in my books \u2013 still better than not touching old code because we could break something.\n\nSo \u2026 yeah. I'm not sure if that helps you, just my point of view.",
            "My experience is that you'll see much the same thing in large enterprise codebases, to a greater or lesser extent, irrespective of which language you're working in. Certainly, the worst things I've seen in Java codebases are worse than the worst things I've seen in Python codebases.\n\nIt's also my experience that large enterprise-y open source projects are about as bad as large enterprise-y internal projects. For example, I've previously attempted to fix issues with Cobbler and Ansible, and (at the risk of causing controversy), found that both are at least as messed up as the internal project I was working on that used them. There's a certain amount of \"this project is my CV\" than motivates maintainers to keep smaller projects sane, but once a project becomes a product, it's subject to the same pointy-haired-boss nonsense as internal projects.\n\nSome languages have a bit less of this, mostly by virtue of being \"a bit weird\" (I'm thinking things like Erlang or Clojure), so only relatively confident developers would use them. But as soon as you've got a project that uses these languages in an organisation with bad hiring practices, you end up with a worse mess than you'd get if you'd used something boring like Java, as developers who don't know the language try and write code in it anyway - Ruby kinda went this way, when it want from being \"a hidden gem\", to \"hip\", to \"something people who look at Gartner quadrants want to try\", to \"the new PHP\".\n\nAll that said, if the problem is (say) that you've got a bunch of mediocre C# developers who are forced to write Python, and are insisting on writing C#-ish Python, maybe the answer is to just use C#.

A good technical leader should protect and promote efforts to improve code quality and to adopt best practices. The leader should allocate time for internal work that can be improve productivity in longer term, like refactorings or training. \n\nIf you can't improve your leaders (e.g. by being promoted to be one), then it is time find a better company.",

I hate running flake8 and being told 400 times that my lines are 10 characters too long - that's not a problem with me, that's a problem with flake8. buried in the noise are a lot of \"variables defined and not used\" which is where all the real bugs are. if 5 times out of 10 it flagged what was basically a bug i'd feel better about it.\n\nI also look at some of these and see problems but not necessarily *big* problems - I don't like import * either but in every code base I've worked on where we've had it it's been the least of our problems so I wouldn't necessarily push it too hard (e.g. wouldnt' necessarily reject an otherwise decent pull request, although i'd comment). I never have it in my open source, but I kind of have to tolerate it and other things like it in commercial code otherwise a lot of production code would just never get deployed.\n\nI don't think you can apply the same rules in open source to commercial code. You're under different pressures and different constraints.\n\nThis isn't to say that code quality doesn't matter but I tend to find that you have to deal with it by identifying 10 problems and figuring out which is the biggest one for *all* of you and fix that rather than having a checklist of guidelines which you can mandate everybody follows or \"code doesn't get merged\". quality gates don't work when people aren't bought into them.\n\nIf they're rejecting the idea of making small changes where it's easy to understand the benefit, that's potentially a different story. i suspect they may be unconvinced of the benefit of many of these things though (& it will take some 'splainin to get them to see the light).",

            "It's better for everyone to move on, and whomever made the choice for the library would be either dragging people screaming and kicking into the new version, or leave a lot of outdated, and vulnerable code out there.\n\nBreak the code in same way to force people onto the new version or they'll be stupid and go with the last stable version and pray.\n\nI don't envy your position, but good luck.",
            "Not enough info to really answer the question.\n\nDo you use features of newer python versions? Does the developer team have the bandwidth to handle whatever work is involved in supporting older versions? \n\nIt comes down to balancing available resources vs resource cost to continue support.\n\nI can easily imagine two different libraries where the answer to the question about supporting older python versions is different because different projects have different amounts of available resources and different amounts of required resources to support older python versions.",
            "HEll YEAH it is.",
            "There isn't a single concept of \"dropping support\", there are many different ways you can execute a sunset policy:\n\n1. You can hard-drop support and start deliberately using new features everywhere and drop all compatibility shims so that won't work in older versions, reject any patches that restores support for older versions.\n\n2. You can drop explicit support for older versions, but keep a \"best-effort\" policy to merge patches that restore support if people made a PR that backports the library to older syntaxes\n\n3. You can drop explicit support for older versions, but don't actually try to actively break older versions, they just don't get tested and it'll only break when someday someone will submit a patch that breaks the older version.\n\n4. You can make a separate maintenance fork for the older versions, they won't get all the new features but if people make PRs on those branch to backport fixes or other features, they're welcome to do so and they will get merged like any others\n\nThere are infinitely many in the spectrum of sunset policy, but ultimately it's the maintainer's decision on what they are willing to spend time supporting on. If the maintainer works in company that uses the library for a mission critical software that still uses Python 2.7, they'd be unlikely to accept dropping support for it as long as that mission critical software is still running on the old version.\n\nIn any case, consider that people who don't upgrade their Python version probably are also fine not getting the latest updates from your library. If they're interested in bleeding edge, they'd have upgraded to Python 3 as well a long time ago.\n\nIf you're not the core maintainer of a project, you won't be making these decisions for them. They're the one that decides what they want to support. If they tell you your PR need to run on 2.7, you make sure they do if you're interested in getting it merged to the project. \n\nIf you're not happy with that situation, you can maintain your own fork, modernize the codebase in your own fork, and publish your own package; pretty much all FLOSS license allows you to do so. If you get enough people interested enough in the changes you're making, the crowd might start shifting to your fork and the two projects can live happily apart. Forked projects that becomes more popular than the original projects are relatively rare, but it happens from time to time.",

        "comments": [
            "While learning/studying it's normal for something to not be intuitive. If everything is directly clear to you then is the study really worth the time? The study is supposed to learn you something, and if you're struggling to understand something but eventually do, it's learning you something.\n\nAlso, what is it that is causing you trouble with loops, maybe I(we on reddit) can help you if we know that?",
            "    my_items = [1, 2, 3]\n    for x in my_items:\n        print(x)\n\nLet's use a simple example. When a loop runs, you are \"iterating\" through each item in the list. The item is assigned to the variable x in the above example. The indented code is then executed. Once we get to the end of the block, the flow goes back to the \"for\" statement. The second value in the list is assigned to x and we execute the indented block of code. This repeats until we run out of items in the list. The flow then continues on with whatever code comes after. \n\nYou could manually write out the above loop, which would be\n\n    x = 1\n    print(x)\n    x = 2\n    print(x)\n    x = 3\n    print(x)\n\nBoth of these code examples will produce the same output. However, the second requires very explicit commands. What if you want a longer set of values, or different values? With the for loop, you can simply provide a new value for my_items and the loop will print each value in the list.",
            "What exactly are you having trouble with?",
            "The best thing that ever helped me out with loops was sounding my loops out in my head as sentences. Python is really great to start that with because it is a coding language that is very close to the English language and how we structure words and sentences. (At least that's how I feel). However, I have taken this approach even in other languages I have learned.\n\nAn example:\n\nSay you have a list and you wanna loop that list, your code might look like so...\n\n```\nmyList = [\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"]\n\nfor letter in myList:\n    do something\n```\n\nHowever, it might make more sense to structure it like a sentence as you write it out.\n\nFor example the above example would be like so:\n\n```\nFor each letter in myList:\n    Do this\n```\n\nJust remember a for loop is generally used to run a piece of code each time for each occurrence of something.\n\nA while loop runs the same piece of code each time until a condition is met.\n\nObviously there are exceptions for both, but just starting out, it's a good way to view them. \n\nSo if you wanted to print hello ten times a while loop would be better. However, if you wanted to print each element in a list, a for loop would be the better option.",
            "Nothing you said is too concerning.  You should at points struggle with course work (you're learning it for the first time).  The key is to keep trying to understand it and be persistent.  \n\nTry learning it from a different source and medium.  By source don't just rely on your class textbook, try a different book (they may just explain it using a phrase that makes it all click for you).  By medium I mean if you've mostly used a textbook try watching a video on loops, or get a friend to explain it to you (or reddit).  These other mediums can trigger different parts of your brain to help it click.\n\nGood luck",
            "Don't quit because something is not immediately intuitive. \n\nAssuming you know that you want to become a computer programmer (which I think is a good idea), soak your brain in loops for a few weeks. \n\nThis means at least one hour of work understanding that subject every day, and more on the weekends. After a few weeks, let it stew for a week or so before revisiting it. This will allow your unconscious mind to digest the information.\n\nThere are many other strategies for learning! One of the most important is to determine your \"learning style\", then make sure you are using that to your advantage.",
            "Try to use a debugger to be able to visualize the state of the variable in the current scope. For instance :\n```\nx = 3\nfor i in range(10):\n    print(x)\n```\nIt's like saying print x 10 times\n\nWhat is also nice to know is that i is actually a variable (something that changes) that will contain 0,1,...,8,9\nIn computer science, we start at 0 =)\nSo if you were to do:\n```\nfor i in range(10):\n    print(i)\n```\nYou would get:\n0\n1\n2\n3\n.\n.\n.\n9\n\nNow what we call a for each in other programming language is when you iterate over all the element of a sequence (a list of element)\n```\nmy_list = [\"a\", \"g\", \"j\"]\nfor i in my_list:\n    print(i)\n```\nWill print :\na\ng\nj\n\nHope you'll understand better =)",
